6376	ive had skyla for almost two years and im very iffy on how i feel towards it the insertion wasnt bad just a big cramp my period used to be only a few days very heavy and i never had cramps with skyla i have light spotting that lasts twice as long with some pretty terrible cramps and nausea the week before i get the spotting i have extreme cravings and gain like five pounds and then lose it all right away from barely eating the week i spot i used to struggle with acne and now my skin is always clear my spouse is sometimes jabbed by the strings i didnt want something with a lot of hormones so i chose skyla over other forms of birth control but i feel like the cons may outweigh the pros for me	1	0	1	0

7719	i wish i never took this pill im not a pill popping kind of person but i had to think about my future with my boyfriend and decided just to try one pill out this was the lowest dose so i figured it would be fine definitely not i havent been eating or motivated as much as i usually am im an emotional person but this pill turned me into a monster i have never been so sad in my entire life i had thoughts of harming myself and was constantly causing arguments with my boyfriend who ive been with for w year and a half and weve never had these problems it has given me horrible head aches and anxiety i would never suggest this to anyone	1	0	1	0
17989	i have been on and off several birth control medications for several years this is my first bad experience i was originally put on ortho tricyclen then ortho tricyclen lo then sprintec then something else but since i have been on trinessa i have yet to stop bleeding i started the first day of my period had my regular period for my usual 7 days and have had continued spotting heavily everyday since now going on my third week as far as birth control is concerned very effective since i havent been able to have sex since i started taking it not exactly my idea of great birth control 	1	0	1	0
2714	was put on this pill after i came off microgynon after 5 years as it made me insane ive been on loestrin for 3 months and will be changing as soon as i can i have been having the most severe nightmares on this pill and i am woken up every night in a tizz also my boobs have grown a cup size which is good but i have also gained weight and cant seem to shift it feel constantly fat also all my life i have had essentially perfect skin but since being on this pill my skin is constantly greasy which has resulted into spots on the plus side mood is generally good and no pregnancys but the nightmares are too big of a deal to carry on	1	0	1	0
11472	ive had nexplanon for 7 months and have been bleeding almost every day for 6 of those months the bleeding is light but enough to wear a tampon so its consistently annoying on the plus side once your body gets used to nexplanon you forget its in your arm and im also not pregnant which at the end of the day is its job i have 3 friends who tried nexplanon and it worked for 2 of them theyre both on their second ones before trying it be aware that some insurances will not pay for you to get it removed if you want it out before the 3 years is up so make sure you check with them in case it doesnt work i do think it was worth the try and would be willing to try it again in the future but it definitely is still quite flawed	1	0	1	0

11850	i had the implanon implant for 3 years and loved it then i had that replaced with the nexplanon which is the same exact implant just more visible in xrays and stuff and i used it for a little over a year i had high hopes for this implant but the only good thing that came from it was not getting pregnant possibly because i barley wanted to have sex because i was on my period all the time i went to the doctor and she prescribed me a med to help regulate my periods and it still didnt help just beware if you get this kind you may have your period all the time or it may go away completely if your lucky to be one of those people i was not	1	0	1	0

12858	ill start with the pros ive had nexplanon for almost 2 years and in terms of effectiveness its amazing it definitely does its job at preventing pregnancy i had pretty light periods to begin with so almost immediately after starting nexplanon my period went away completely i also dont ever have to worry about taking the pill like i had before which is great now for the cons since ive had nexplanon ive gained a lot of weight i started at 125 and am now 150 which is pretty significant i think my anxiety has also been off the charts crazy since the first day i got it in other than that id say the pros out weigh the cons but currently im looking into a nonhormonal option just to see if this was truly causing my weight gain	1	0	1	0

7923	this is the only birth control ive ever been on so i dont have a point of comparison but i dont think its helpful at all i started it because i was having periods every two weeks for about 2 months im in my third month of taking it and not only do i still randomly get my period in the middle of the month but if i am so much as 5 minutes early or late taking the pill in the morning ill get my period again i already had depression and it made it so much worse than it already was that i had to go back into therapy acne is no better or worse i guess the only thing it did right was that it sort of made my cramps better and then not to mention the fact that even after insurance its still 50 which i cant afford every month	1	0	1	0

6216	i was on implanon for exactly one year before i got it removed i did not like this birthcontrol as i had horrible sideeffects i chose this birth control because the only birth control ive been on was depo the shot which i got every three months so i thought three years thats great however after about 6 months i felt as though i was losing weight i had what felt like constant spotting so my menstruation  never stopped it felt like and my libido was in overdrive so the doctor said one year to the day i got it took out and went back on the shot where ill stay	1	0	1	0

13475	first this pill kind of freaks me out with the whole quothave to take it within the hour at the sametime everydayquot i also deal with no period of a week period of 3 days no period for 4 days then period of another 2 dayson and on and on i have been on it for three months and thinking that this might not be the pill for me it has given me some anxiety and increased my mood swings i do have breast tenderness at times probably not the pill for me but i was put on it since other birth control pills give me a headache and so far this pill has never given me a headache so at least that has worked	1	0	1	0
18267	first pill i tried it didnt really give me noticeable side effects but not many benefits besides no pregnancy it didnt decrease cramps by much i still got wicked headaches that would make me nauseous and it decreased my sex drive over all when i stopped taking it i felt like i had come out of a fog as if the pill had been dulling senses beyond just my sex drive happier to be on sprintec now	1	0	1	0
11976	spotting for two weeks then period for a week followed by a couple days spotting then two weeks later it starts all over again i was told to wait six months before i have it taken out they told me my period could go away completely my body just has to get used to it my sex life is suffering 	1	0	1	0
9073	i was on the depo for two years and was awesome for the first 6 months i seriously thought i was in heaven i still had periods but had absolutely no cramps at all which is saying a lot since i had horrible pains before and the bleeding was light i started the depo because i couldnt remember the pill things were going well and then i started a period that lasted for a year i would have stayed on the depo regardless of the bleeding but it was the horrible mood swings that made me stop using it i was seriously a miserable person though this was my experience it could be different for others my body never reacts the way it should really the only way to know is to try it yourself	1	0	1	0
2585	horrible pill went on it after getting my iud taken out it was giving me a period every time my husband and i had sex and the doctor told me it would help me gain an appetite instead in the past 35 months ive gotten sick 5 times had one missed period and the worst period of my life after as a quotcatch upquot one i cant take the tiredness heavy body and constant upset tummy any more	1	0	1	0

11967	i got the implant inserted 3 days ago the shot wasnt so bad actually but the insertion hurt maybe because the doctor placed it in the wrong area from where she gave me the shotin the first 30 mins i felt my vision blurry and everyday since then also the insertion area is really tender and every time i make a certain moves with my arm i feel pain in that area hopefully that goes away i cant say anything about my period yet until i get itsince i barely got it a week before the insertion	1	0	1	0
9986	i was switched from loestrin 24 to this since it was discontinued and at first i was super nervous because it was chewable but i liked loestrin so i went with it the first month was okay and it was exactly like loestrin 24 with nothing different the second month i was told by my doctor that i can skip the placebo pills to not have my period and i did just that the first week after doing so was great but then i started to spot i knew it would happen but its been going on consecutively for three weeks and its into the next pack now its also caused mood swings headaches and i never get those vision blurriness here and there cramps bloating gassy all the upsetting side effects overall not good and i may switch to another bc	1	0	1	0
8557	this birth control was advised to me strictly to help the awful symptoms of my menstrual cycle stomach aches heavy bleeding etc6 and loestrin ended up taking my period away for over a year this although it seems amazing did not seem healthy to me at all i also lost a ton of hair the first month or so of going on it my hair is still not healthy as it was before barely grows a lot drier i currently am off of it and it took me almost 4 months to finally get my period back again now that the symptoms are back in full swing i am wishing i never went off of it obviously but i am definitely afraid of going back on it and losing my hair all over again so it looks like i am toughing out the symptoms with the rest of the female race	1	0	1	0

12264	ok so i decided to go on nexplanon in august of 2014 and i had read all the side effects and all of them had happened i had my period for a week and a half then about every other month i had one but it was less time each time and way less bleeding and now its almost been a whole year since i got it done and i now have no signs of a period or spotting and discharge i had asked my sister if not having a period was a bad thing and she said yes so im not sure if i should get this removed because of me not having a period all my hormones are fine everything about the birth control is amazing for me i just dont ever have a period	1	0	1	0
6872	i had a horrible experience i got it done last friday 61716 they never mentioned anything about it being painful and they never offered me any pain pills and there was no injection of analgesics to the cervix like ive read other people getting after the fact it literally felt like i was going to give birth it was very painful and im a tough cookie and im really upset that they had to open up my cervix to do it yes they open up your cervix i thought they just inserted it through the cervicle whole but no its only been in a day and im having really bad cramping and headaches i wish i never got it im getting it removed asap  if you do plan to do it make sure you take 800 mg ibuprofen before hand	1	0	1	0
14654	i started the patch because i had difficulty to remember to take the pill every night at first i liked it yes it shows but it was not a problem to me but however i would apply it the corners would never stick to my skin which is a problem since the active ingredient is on the whole patch plus the menstrual cramps were much stronger and my period lasted longer than usual but the last day that i changed my patch i went into the shower right after and fainted when i got back up i was so dizzy i couldnt walk straight i lied down and threw up it was like being super hangover but i barely ever drink i removed the patch and 30 minutes later i was feeling way better im going back to the pill	1	0	1	0

14151	i was on the nuvaring for 2 years i loved it however i started getting low back pain on a saturday and thought nothing of it monday i had a doctor appointment the dull pain was still there but i thought maybe it was because i was going to take the ring out in a few days to start my cycle however that night my leg started swelling by the next morning the pain was so unreal i almost vomited i went to the er where they discovered i had a rapid growing blood clot in my femoral vein area between groin and upper  leg that was 6 inches long i was put on xarelto for 3 months and on bed rest for a week as they were so concerned it would break off and go into my lungs or heart it took me 6 months to fully recover from the clot	1	0	1	0

when does this end
when does it regulate itself

3134	i have been using loestrin 24 fe for 7 months i love the fact that my periods are a lot lighter because lord knows i had the longest most painful periods ever my breasts have grown a whole cup size and they feel as though they might keep growing i love the weight in my breasts but i have gained 5 pounds and i eat the same if not better than before i got on the pill and i exercise just as much so im considering stopping the pill and switching to another method of birth control because weight gain and me do not mix well i have had a large amount of spot bleeding it has decreased as the months have gone on other than the weight gain this pill has been my best fiend so if it doesnt seem to make you gain weight i would say it is the best	1	0	1	0
13674	ive started this birth control and its been shy of a month for me i did experience nauseousness for the first week then it went away i hardly had an appetite as well however i noticed large amounts of hair shedding after i showered each time and my hair is noticeable feeling thinner than ever before very depressing i had to completely stop taking it	1	0	1	0
6886	let me start about the insertion of the iud its not just a small pinch especially if your cervical is small like mine it will hurt and after the pain is terrible bad cramping  after during my six week follow up i was scared to use a tampon because i was scared it was going to touch the string  how ever sex my sex drive decreased before i would be crazy now im just okay but scared to be rough because im still afraid he was going to touch it  and a lot of out the blew spotting and period  the cramping pain level is 810 depending on you  but its go away come back five minutes later worse than before i do not recommend you to get it terrible  i would rather have weight gain vs periods and weeks of spotting terrible cramps 	1	0	1	0
8486	"when i originally took microgestin 120 by watson it was amazing particularly after the first couple of months of taking when my body got use to it my breasts went up a cup size amp there were little to no side effects lighter periods no pregnancy win

then after almost two years a dark cloud called actavis became the new manufacturer and shattered my love for microgestin something changed in the formula because i was suddenly sick during the first week of each new pack to the point that id throw up at times random cramping gained about a pd a week  not a deal breaker but still sucks heavy exhausting 23 day periods two side effects worsened over time melasma and mood swings needless to say its goodbye time beware"	1	0	1	0

10126	i had mirena put in about a week ago amp it by far the most excruciating pain ive ever felt im missing some of my left leg due to a motorcycle accident so believe me when i say i know pain the insertion was worse than any of my surgeries i had to make my obgyn stop bc the pain amp discomfort made me so light headed amp sick to my stomach the pain amp cramping for the first 2 days after made it impossible to move amp now a week later i still have bad discomfort amp spotting ive noticed an increase in appetite amp acne on my face that i never had problems with before i had mirena placed as an option to help my severe bipolar mood swings but i think this may not have been the right option for me im giving it a few more days to change my mind	1	0	1	0

9263	i had been getting the depo shot for about a year i decided a few weeks ago that i no longer wanted this as my method of birth control when i first started getting the shot i had some spotting and no periods this has slowly increased and for the past two months i have had spotting everyday i thought i could put up with it before i realized that my libido had been slowly decreasing as well and for the past month or month and a half my sex drive has been virtually nonexistent i was not able to quotget in the moodquot no weight gain 	1	0	1	0
1902	i got this 4 weeks after my daughter was born and since ive had it my depression has hit the fan ive got uncontrollable migraines after november 2013 i had a period every other day and it only lasted an hour not to mention i have gained 60lbs and my doctor refuses to remove it	1	0	1	0
6704	insertion process was extremely painful broken many bones and this tops the charts it was the last day of my period and i had even taken 800mg of ibuprofen beforehand np also put lidocaine on my cervix prior to insertion drove home after appnt without much discomfort light cramping and lethargic the rest of the day and went to bed early woke up 2 hrs later with excruciating cramps and could not sleep the rest of the night little to no side effects 2 wks following at which time i started my period again cramping became more severe and bleeding proceeded for 10 days with sharp stabbing pain in cervix like insertion pain couldnt take the pain after 1 wk of persistent symptoms and had iud removed also gained 8 lbs in lt3 wks	1	0	1	0
8398	was put on this pill after i came off microgynon after 5 years as it made me insane ive been on loestrin for 3 months and will be changing as soon as i can i have been having the most severe nightmares on this pill and i am woken up every night in a tizz also my boobs have grown a cup size which is good but i have also gained weight and cant seem to shift it feel constantly fat also all my life i have had essentially perfect skin but since being on this pill my skin is constantly greasy which has resulted into spots on the plus side mood is generally good and no pregnancys but the nightmares are too big of a deal to carry on	1	0	1	0
9278	i was on depo for about 5 years my period would immediatly stop everytime i took the shot that is the only positive aside from that i gained about 30 pounds from the shot thank god i was really small when i got on it  and my fat is in the quot rightquot places however it doesnt change the fact that this is something that should not be on the market doctors will tell you that it is your diet that is causing the weight gain however my diet is the same as it was years ago i decided to get off the shot  as getting a period is a part of woman hood and not enough of a reason to keep injecting something that awful in my body i have been off about 6 months now thankfully my periods are regular now but i plan to see a dietician soon	1	0	1	0
5610	i had the implanon for almost a year i never stopped bleeding the entire time prior to the implanon i was getting the depo provera shot i had been getting that for 3 years and never stopped bleeding on that either that was the only negative side effect for me unfortunately bleeding nonstop for a year is pretty bad almost defeats the purpose of birth control i gave it a 2 because i like that i didnt have to worry at all about it it was in and i didnt have to remember to take a pill or change anything my doctor says if you want to try the implanon try the depo provera shot first and if you bleed constantly on that dont switch to implanon if you do good on depo provera shot the implanon will most likely work for you as well	1	0	1	0

5060	i was put on this bc to prevent pregnancy i guess i should preface this review by saying i was off hormonal bc for almost 4 years so my reaction could have been in part due to that fact i was only able to take this bc for 4 days the first thing i noticed was the nausea and the ill feeling i had throughout the whole day i couldnt eat my appetite decreased a lot it made my anxiety 3x worse and it also made me depressed to the point where it was getting crippling and i couldnt go through the day without feeling like i needed to cry at the most random times i read some people saying they had a feeling of dread while taking this bc i had that too i had the worst insomnia ive had in my life worst bc ive ever taken	1	0	1	0

pros ive never gotten pregnant my boobs went up 2 cup sizes its not uncomfortable at all it regulated my period much easier than the pill you put it in then you can forget about it for 3 weeks but the best thing for me was that it cleared my acne 

cons i am moody more depressed will cry for any little thing i have always been 110 pounds my whole life with tiny fluctuations now im heading towards 125 pounds no sex drive at all broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years because we never had sex it gives me constant bv and daily vaginal discharge which is the worst side effect to me

538	i had the paragard inserted around may 2015 after i had my first child on march 27th i was attracted to the thought of it being hormone free and that i would hopefully have far fewer negative side effects that i had had thru years of trying different versions of the pill insertion was not bad at all for me a tiny bit of cramping and then the worst of that was the cramping became a bit more severe when i got home and into the next day it has stayed in place but that is honestly the only good thing i can say about it i have never been one to have very heavyirregular  periods or heavy cramping and since i have gotten paragard i have had the most irregular heavy periods of my life and the cramping has been unbearable at times	1	0	1	0
7488	i had the lilttea placement today about 4 hours ago i am going to make this a basic first day review and i promise to update going forward placement went well slow deep breaths i talked to keep me focused insertion took under 5 minutes and was on par with vaginal exams from the past no pinchstabbing note i have a backward tilted uterus and cervix makes it hard to get to ive had two babies non medicated vaginal deliveries so my pain tolerance is higher than most so i would expect the worst and hope fot the best i had it done half way through my period i will track my bleeding and see what changes so far mild to bad cramps that went away with a hot bath and ibprofin so excited to hopefully not get pregnant again so is hubs	1	0	1	0
10333	i am 21 years old and i got my mirena inserted july 2nd because my gyno recommended it to me instead of pill birth control i didnt take any medicine since i didnt have any on me but i did experience a terrible cramp feeling when i had it inserted i took advil for the next 48 hours i still experience cramps every day but its not unbearable i am hoping it goes away soon my period is gone but i have been spotting a tiny bit nothing crazy after hearing all these crazy stories i am getting a little nervous about this i will right again in a week or so	1	0	1	0

9570	before getting on microgestin fe 120 i was on yasmin  i never had any problems with yasmin although my period was slightly heavier than desirable  i have been on microgestin now for four months and literally go through 2 full period cycles in a row each month  it is awful and inconvenient  my doctor actually put me on the pill because of the reports of shorter periods  i know that all bodies react differently but be cautious of this problem if you do not want to chance it  i have also experienced severe mood swings but i cannot discredit it regarding actual birth control  just remember to take it at the same time daily	1	0	1	0
4890	i was on the depo shot when i was 18 and had 3 shots and boy did i bleed the best part was the fact that i never had any cramps but i bled for over 2 years straight and didnt have a regular cycle intill reaching the 3rd year	1	0	1	0
12022	i got my nexplanon inserted april of 2015 it is now august of 2015 and i will probably get it out soon i was so excited to get this for the obvious reason my gyno told me the facts that eventually you wont get your period anymore and that you wont be able to get pregnant for 3 years which is great when you have a boyfriend unfortunately nexplanon didnt live up to my expectations at all i bleed for the first 4 months straight heavy spotting type of bleeding and it was miserable i havent gotten pregnant which is a perk but thats probably because i rarely have sex because im always bleeding its been a miserable expirence which is so dissapointing but hopefully im getting it out soon	1	0	1	0

4807	i was on lutera before it was suggested that i switch to the generic form of yaz in order to help clear up my skin  so i did  for the first weeks or so i was very tired and had excruciating headaches both of which were very out of character for me  this resolved after about a week  as for my skin it took probably about 4 months to clear up but after it cleared up it stayed that way thanks to yaz  on the negative side this pill brought my libido into the negative  also dryness became an issue which of course further effected my libido in a negative way besides just being embarrassing in general  now my insurance has decided to no longer cover it so i am switching i am worried about my skin but excited to have my sex life back	1	0	1	0

255	at first i loved this birth control i used to have a heavy period with loads of cramps then i got on this and had no cramps and very little bleeding the only downfall of this was after a week or two on it my breakouts became very bad i have really sensitive skin so this could be because of that but also ive read other reviews and acne was a side effect of this specific type	1	0	1	0
7750	the first week or two on lo loestrin fe went really well for me i had very minimal side effects however as my first menstrual cycle on the pill came around everything seemed to change it wasnt an awful period it was actually light with minimal cramping but during this time i realized my digestion was completely off and i developed acid reflux which id never dealt with before constant headaches and brain fog became the norm for me as well as nauseousness and abdominal pain i also became way more fatigued and even developed dry mouth before starting this medication i felt completely fine but four months later i feel worse than ever am stopping this medication as soon as this month ends	1	0	1	0

16273	ive had skyla for about 5 months now and i have to say i dont love it the insertion process was not as bad as i thought despite the crazy reviews once i got it however i had pretty intense cramps lower back pain amp other period symptoms for at least a month i am used to very painful cramps and i can usually handle them but it was honestly a nightmare my immediate reaction to this was to get it removed but i thought i was being a bit rash and i would just leave it in and give it a fair shot as time went on the cramps did subside and my body felt better but still not back to normal i also noticed i was beginning to break out a lot and ive had clear skin my entire life not only was i breaking out but it was also painful to have sex	1	0	1	0
10404	well i had the merena for over 2 years and the great thing about it is that i never had a period and i didnt have to worry about getting pregnant the worse part was is that i had a terrible terrible odor constantly im the type of person who showers daily and it was embarrassing also i was never in the quotmoodquot to have sex  so i decided to get it removed and it has been over 6 months now and i have had absolutely no odor and my quotmoodquot toward sex has changed a lot for the better everyone is different and it is pretty much a see and try for yourself kind of thing	1	0	1	0

8449	its crazy to me that there are so many good reviews because this pill was bad for me every body is different and we all react differentlybut i definitely did not have a good experience with this one ive been on and off many other birth controls but never reacted to any like i did to this one within a week i was a deranged emotional rollercoaster of a messcried over nothing for no reason randomly and couldnt control it almost ended my then 3 year relationshipdepression to the max immediately asked my dr to take me off it and within a couple days i was back to normal so crazy how much hormones can mess with you you just have to find the right combination that works for your body	1	0	1	0

15110	i am 20 and have been using this birth control a little over a year it is my first birth control pill effective at preventing pregnancy but thats the only plus overall i think its an okay pill but i wouldnt say its the best it takes about three months to adjust to it and taking it at night helps with the nausea and headaches you may experience i have gained 15 pounds while on the pill which is very disappointing because my diet is better now than it was before and ive always been very active and attend the gym the weight is hard for me to shed nowits frustrating my periods are normal for the most part but sometimes they come a little later and carry over when im back on active pills 	1	0	1	0

4915	"okay ill do pros and cons here because there are plenty to say for both
pros cleared up my acne tremendously i only broke out slightly around my period but other than that i was the clearest than i had been since puberty also my breasts went up about half a cup size which is always fun in terms of weight i didnt notice much of a difference neither loss or gain
con it made me horribly depressed it was a gradual slump but after about 5 months on it i went from being bubbly social and dedicated student athlete to someone who didnt want to do much but sit in bed and sleep all day i was still sociable but it took effort i finally stopped gianvi and was back to normal in a month everyones different but be careful on this medicine"	1	0	1	0
7976	i am about halfway through my 2nd pack of lo loestrin fe  the first month i had minor spotting on one day no big deal i also noticed that i had a couple of pimples but since there were only a couple i figured it could have been my normal hormonal changes during the month  however halfway through this second month and my chinmouth area has never had such acne  i had occasional acne like many people but 90 of the time my skin was clear before   now i feel like i wake up everyday with a new batch of red spots  i want to stop this pill now midpack but dont want to give myself menstrual issues at the same time so im trying to stick it out until the end of the pack	1	0	1	0

2259	i had previously been on the pill for many years and thought that switching to nexplanon would make life a bit easier it was okay for the first few months though my period was really unpredictable starting in november 2015 my period remained constant through when i got it removed in february 2016 a week after my acne is cleared up i have more energy i am less moody i am less bloated looking through some other reviews i think my problems over the past year with acne weight gain and mood swings may be partially attributable to nexplanon my doctor told me that nexplanon either works really well or not at all if you get nexplanon i would urge you to have it removed at the outset of any trouble rather than waiting as long as i did	1	0	1	0
