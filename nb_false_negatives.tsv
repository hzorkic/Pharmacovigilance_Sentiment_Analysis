11070	so i just started this birth control almost 2 weeks ago i am 24 and this is my very first birth control i have ever used i was prescribed this pill to help with pcos symptoms i read reviews before taking my first pill and was super scared i was expecting to feel horrible the first 4 days i felt nothing at all except extreme sleepiness and my appetite has gone down some the 5th day i had a horrible headachedizzinessnausea and i ended up sleeping it off i pushed the time i take the pill to later evening because i have felt so sleepy since starting this medication i dont really see it being listed as a side affect and im not sure if anyone else has the same problem but i am pretty positive its the pill	0	1	0	1
13957	i am very glad to use this birth control because for me there werent any side effects i am very satisfied for this product the pills make me sick and i feel nauseous all the time i have had aches vomiting pains in my abdomen and i was very very dizzy	0	1	0	1
15107	i have been using tri cyclen lo for almost 2 years and i have decided to switch to nordette i like tri cyclen lo for not getting me pregnant but it gave me a few side effects that i didnt want to live with again i had a huge decrease in sex drive i gained 25 lbs in weight i cried a lot for any situation i had mood swings and my period lasted 5 6 days and heavy with pain i think the only good thing is that it cleared acne very well my period came exactly on time and no pregnancies i hope nordette works better for me	0	1	0	1
2456	i had this inserted in october 2013 after consulting with my doctor who pushed it for the convenience insertion was quick and painless with minor stinging the first 2 months were awful with acne depression crying and mood swings which stabilized once i recognized the cause months 4 to 6 were even worse because i would not stop bleeding numerous times i wanted it removed but my doctor told me to give my body 6 months to adjust finally after almost 10 months my body is doing better bleeding has stopped for 6 weeks and counting although i am fighting slight weight gain of 3 to 5 pounds yes you cannot beat the convenience but you need to seriously consider the side effects because they were unbearable many times for me	0	1	0	1
2035	"i had horrible pain for 1 week out of every month and was in and out of the hospital trying to figure out what was causing the pain then my obgyn recommend i get the iud
i am on my second one no more periods and no more pain every month knock on wood"	0	1	0	1
9534	at first i just experienced stomach troubles occasionally with this pill on the plus side it made my period much lighter but it has been inconsistent i usually have a 25day cycle i have been 10 days late and 5 days early on this pill then the 10 pounds came on and quite quickly im 44 and have been the same weight for 20 years so it was upsetting to have clothes suddenly fit very tightly i havent changed my diet or exercise regime so i attribute the gain to this pill i feel bloated most of the time too other than that i didnt experience the other side effects some are experiencing 	0	1	0	1
12281	well when i first got it it didnt hurt at all just feels really weird when i put pressure on it or hit it on something i think i may have gained 10lbs since i got this in july i havent had periods just spotting at random times sex drive was completely nonexistent for a few months but other than that no pregnancies or serious problems i recommend it if you can get by the side effects for a few months	0	1	0	1
13823	i love it not having to take a pill everyday its amazing so far ive been on it for 3 weeks now i havent tried having sex yet because my doctor told me to wait i hated take the pill and yaz and trisprintec made me so depressed moody and i had no sex drive no mood swings yet and i start next week my sex drive is getting better so wish me luck	0	1	0	1
17545	there is not one birth control method you can find that doesnt have complaints  all the complaints are the same too  i have tried nuva ring ortho and the mirena which all of them were a thumbs down for me  i have been on trisprintec for a month now and this is the best fit  ive had no stomach issues and i have a phobia of nausea and vomiting  i have to say my biggest complaint would be the bloating in my stomach  my stomach and my hunger have increased i cant completely say its the pill because ive also quit smoking and ive replaced food for my smoking habit  my acne has been pretty badlike super huge bumps everywhere  my mood is here and there which is sort of normal for me anyway  i like the pill overall though	0	1	0	1
4099	i really really wanted to love the mirena i had inserted on february 14 2011 yes valentines day and finally had it removed today it definitely made my periods lighter but i also had 2 a month every month at 9 days each typically my period is fairly heavy but only 5 days and only once a month that was complaint 1 i was constantly bloated and gained 19 lbs despite working out and dieting my biggest complaint is that i had huge emotionalhoromonal issues with this everything from random crying to just being extremely emotional even depressed at times i am a fairly happy person normally i had the mirena removed and replaced with a paragard i really like the aspects of the iud and not having to worry regularly	0	1	0	1
3482	i have been on this birth control for maybe going on my third month so far i have more positives than negatives i have barely had any acne at all maybe one here and there im not very emotional either before i began taking sprintec i always had horrifying cramps at the beginning of my period each month now i barely have any at all the worst part about this birth control for me is that ive gained 20 pounds and it is noticeable	0	1	0	1
11997	i wouldnt recommend nexplanon to anyone unless you want to gain weight i bleed every other week for about 6 months but then it stopped and i didnt have a cylce for the next 2 in a half years never got pregnant which was the best part about this birth control but my mood swings were horrible and i gained 30 pounds in a 3 yr period i always worked out and ate a good diet but the weight would not get off of me i finally got it removed and ive lost the entire 30 pounds i lost	0	1	0	1
11264	i had the implant for two years the first yr was nice no symptoms or anything second was awful tho my bleeding was 3 weeks long a got awful acne violent cramps and so so so so moody like i literally wanted to kill someone i couldnt take it anymore so u got it out and let me just say getting it put in is much easier than taking it out im now on the pill but thats just my experience it varies for everyone i didnt get pregnant tho hahaha	0	1	0	1
17875	"i was on trinessa for almost 6 months it did its job on birth control my acne was almost gone with this medication and less hormonal during my time of the month worked great for me no abnormal bleeding with this one

the bad effect that happened to me during the 6 month period i had gained 25 pounds i went from 110 to 135lbs i wasnt like a twig i was fit but then after this i got tired and just ate all the time i also would get really nauseous from the first 2 weeks works well but the side effects were bad

12333	easiest way to not have babies light bleeding for a month headaches mood swings acne and weight gain after 4 months all clear up except for the waight gain it was only 13 pounds but for my height it was alot no periods for almost 1 year and half after that i had normal to light periods every other month my doctor decided to remove it because i wasnt able to lose those gained pounds  we thought it will be better with something else with less hormones	0	1	0	1
5215	"i loved the implanon for the first year of use  it was easy painless and effective  i barely got a period the entire first year on it awesome it also had no effect on my high blood pressure i would have recommended it to anyone 1010 times 

now that i have had it for a year and a half i change my mind  i have read that it becomes less effective in preventing pms symptoms over time and it has proven to be true

the past 4 months i have been randomly bleeding for days on end multiple times a month painful cramps and intense mood swings i just made an appointment to have it removed 
everyone is different but i would most recommend the implanon for a year of use  definitely worth it for that period of time"	0	1	0	1

14897	i have been using this pill for almost three months now it has worked great for preventing pregnancy and has made my periods lighter with less cramping at first i was experiencing some abdominal cramping but that went away after a while the only side effect that has caused me problems is it made me very emotional i get depressed easily but not on a daily basis usually every one to two weeks i go through a phase where i cry a lot and think about things from my past that upset me judging from what i have read the emotional side effects go away after a while so i want to keep taking it and i would recommend it for anyone	0	1	0	1

1668	"i used aubra for two functions as a contraceptive and as a way to reduce acne i would call it a positive experience since its main function was to reduce risk of pregnancy and i did not become pregnant while using it 
however there are side effects as with any oral contraceptive different pills use different kinds of synthetic hormones each of which may or may not have a different effect on the users skin
aubra is partly comprised of levonorgestrel which is one of the most androgenic acne causing synthetic hormones used in oral contraceptives

12678	this birth control is great if your one to forget the pill like myself but ive been on it for a year and have gained at least 40 pounds im seriously thinking about removing it and getting an iud  ive always been a bigger girl weighing around 180190 but this past year ive been more active in my career than ever and ive gained 40 pounds i dont understand what else it could be besides this thing	0	1	0	1
5284	"ive had two implanons in four years with the first one i gained around 20kgs obviously not from the implanon itself but more likely as a result of a massive hormone change i had the first one for almost three years before i decided to have it removed as it caused such a profound hormone imbalance i ended up with a harmless but embarrassing discharge for the last nine months 
the second implanon i had implanted in early 2015 it started off fine one menstrual cycle every 23 months but now i am lightly bleeding for two weeks of every month with terrible hormonal acne and cramps 
this device has been a wonderful thing for me most of the time so i allow it a bit of leeway in terms of unwanted effects"	0	1	0	1

11067	severe nausea and multiple nearpuke experiences almost threw up on a kid at my job serving him food made certain foods sickening to smell or look at craved unhealthy foods which i did not partake in so no weight gain did its job to regulate periods not sure about the pregnancy prevention since my doctor recommended still using condoms for the first month i liked this one  it sucks that the doctor switched my birth control pills to something else right when i had stopped getting the overbearing chronic nausea if you feel nauseous  wait it out it will pass maybe try an anti nausea medication with it until the first month is over	0	1	0	1
