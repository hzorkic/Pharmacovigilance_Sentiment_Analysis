11070	so i just started this birth control almost 2 weeks ago i am 24 and this is my very first birth control i have ever used i was prescribed this pill to help with pcos symptoms i read reviews before taking my first pill and was super scared i was expecting to feel horrible the first 4 days i felt nothing at all except extreme sleepiness and my appetite has gone down some the 5th day i had a horrible headachedizzinessnausea and i ended up sleeping it off i pushed the time i take the pill to later evening because i have felt so sleepy since starting this medication i dont really see it being listed as a side affect and im not sure if anyone else has the same problem but i am pretty positive its the pill	0	1	0	1
13957	i am very glad to use this birth control because for me there werent any side effects i am very satisfied for this product the pills make me sick and i feel nauseous all the time i have had aches vomiting pains in my abdomen and i was very very dizzy	0	1	0	1
15107	i have been using tri cyclen lo for almost 2 years and i have decided to switch to nordette i like tri cyclen lo for not getting me pregnant but it gave me a few side effects that i didnt want to live with again i had a huge decrease in sex drive i gained 25 lbs in weight i cried a lot for any situation i had mood swings and my period lasted 5 6 days and heavy with pain i think the only good thing is that it cleared acne very well my period came exactly on time and no pregnancies i hope nordette works better for me	0	1	0	1
2456	i had this inserted in october 2013 after consulting with my doctor who pushed it for the convenience insertion was quick and painless with minor stinging the first 2 months were awful with acne depression crying and mood swings which stabilized once i recognized the cause months 4 to 6 were even worse because i would not stop bleeding numerous times i wanted it removed but my doctor told me to give my body 6 months to adjust finally after almost 10 months my body is doing better bleeding has stopped for 6 weeks and counting although i am fighting slight weight gain of 3 to 5 pounds yes you cannot beat the convenience but you need to seriously consider the side effects because they were unbearable many times for me	0	1	0	1
9534	at first i just experienced stomach troubles occasionally with this pill on the plus side it made my period much lighter but it has been inconsistent i usually have a 25day cycle i have been 10 days late and 5 days early on this pill then the 10 pounds came on and quite quickly im 44 and have been the same weight for 20 years so it was upsetting to have clothes suddenly fit very tightly i havent changed my diet or exercise regime so i attribute the gain to this pill i feel bloated most of the time too other than that i didnt experience the other side effects some are experiencing 	0	1	0	1
13823	i love it not having to take a pill everyday its amazing so far ive been on it for 3 weeks now i havent tried having sex yet because my doctor told me to wait i hated take the pill and yaz and trisprintec made me so depressed moody and i had no sex drive no mood swings yet and i start next week my sex drive is getting better so wish me luck	0	1	0	1
4099	i really really wanted to love the mirena i had inserted on february 14 2011 yes valentines day and finally had it removed today it definitely made my periods lighter but i also had 2 a month every month at 9 days each typically my period is fairly heavy but only 5 days and only once a month that was complaint 1 i was constantly bloated and gained 19 lbs despite working out and dieting my biggest complaint is that i had huge emotionalhoromonal issues with this everything from random crying to just being extremely emotional even depressed at times i am a fairly happy person normally i had the mirena removed and replaced with a paragard i really like the aspects of the iud and not having to worry regularly	0	1	0	1
2611	i have been on depo provera since april 2009 and now its december 2009 i had an okay experience the best thing about it was that it stopped my period right away which was really nice for sports i did not gain weight have nausea or sore breasts but it really lowered my sex drive and it made me drier than normal for the first few months i think it caused some hair loss but not too much my boyfriend said i was really moody on it which has really interfered with our relationship i think i had some depression because of that i am switching to the nuvaring in two weeks and hopefully i will be less moody all over depo provera was okay i would recommend trying it at least to see how you react to it	0	1	0	1
28	2 years ago i had it inserted there was some intense cramping during the quotsoundquot and the actual insertion but it took less than five minutes and there was no pain but slight discomfort for the rest of the day i got my period a week early and it was much heavier than before used to be light 6 days changed to extremely heavy 5 days my period has gotten less extreme over time and now it is extremely heavy for 3 days it took a few months to not feel it at all occasionally once every 69 months sex is too rough and i get stabbing pain in uterus for a few days but other than that i am able to tell my partner when it is too rough and i dont have any pain partner felt it once in the 2  years ive had it 810 for the heavy periods	0	1	0	1
12257	i had my fourth baby girl 33113 and got the nexplanon inserted 5613 and i was not bleeding when i got it a week later i started my period and it was light the first 3 days and then became heavy i started being nausea headache and had terrible cramps i then decided to look up some reviews and side effects after reading some reviews i became scared about the bleeding but today is 3 weeks since i got it and i stopped bleeding today so that was a total of 2 weeks of bleeding and it did lighten up after 9 days so i decided to keep it it all really depends on your body so you would have to try it amp see for yourself it is doing good for me and hopefully it does good for you	0	1	0	1
15315	i have had paragard for a year and a half when it was inserted i did have pain but that was mainly just strong cramping  i dont remember really bleeding afterwards for those that say they have the worst pain in their life during insertion is probably because of the way their cervix sits my dr explain that to me because a week before my period is supposed to start i get these horrible stabbing pains that are sometimes unbearable they arent constant and have actually lessened over time my periods have actually gotten lighter only lasting like 4 days until now my last period was like two weeks ago and then all of the sudden this week i started bleeding i havent read any reviews on this so we will see what happens	0	1	0	1
5215	"i loved the implanon for the first year of use  it was easy painless and effective  i barely got a period the entire first year on it awesome it also had no effect on my high blood pressure i would have recommended it to anyone 1010 times 

now that i have had it for a year and a half i change my mind  i have read that it becomes less effective in preventing pms symptoms over time and it has proven to be true

the past 4 months i have been randomly bleeding for days on end multiple times a month painful cramps and intense mood swings i just made an appointment to have it removed 
everyone is different but i would most recommend the implanon for a year of use  definitely worth it for that period of time"	0	1	0	1

1683	i got nexplanon inserted february 12 i had my period since january 25 i decided to try nexplanon because the depo provera gave me mood swings and longer periods i have had my period now for almost 7 weeks i dont know if its because of the depo or if its also the nexplanon i have gained 7lbs since starting this its been great for birth control but that may because i havent had sex	0	1	0	1
12564	i got the implant in march 16 so i havent had it all that long yet the day i got it i had my period for two weeks straight and was spotting pretty frequently after that i definitely feel like the implant has changed me i often feel depressed and am extremely moody and i hasnt effected my libido thankfully also i keep having dreams that im either pregnant or have a baby which started after i got the implant i feel so bad for my bf but he knows its the side effects i finally stopped spotting hopefully but other than the mood swings i cant really complain it beats having to take a pill everyday	0	1	0	1
9887	im 23 and was on microgestin for 4  years the only major side effect i experienced was not getting my period at all for the last 3 of those years my doctor explained that its not uncommon for microgestin to thin the lining of the uterus so much that theres nothing left to shed and although i certainly wasnt going to complain it was still kind of weird zero cramps headaches nausea spotting mood swings weight change or change in sex drive the only down side was that my face broke out about halfway through my pill pack every month not really terrible acne just annoying pimples ive since switched to ocella and seen a huge improvement in my skin although i got my period again the first month i switched 	0	1	0	1
9739	i was on loestrin 24 fe for years until they stopped making samples of it and it was too expensive to buy my doctor switched me to this pill i lost 1520 lbs moods have been more stable and my sex drive has increased dramatically the only con was i did break out really bad when i first switched but now im on my 3rd pack and im getting my breakouts under control im amazed at the weight i lost and didnt realize i gained it from my old birth control this is my new favourite	0	1	0	1
7729	the first month i had it in i was supposed to start my period but i didnt start it til two weeks later it lasted about a week then spotting for a few days after that since then i have not had a period i like that i dont have to worry about a period at all i am 51 and started weight 130 when i started right now i weigh 133 i did go up to 148 but that was due to a medical issue completely apart after being treated i am going back to my usual weight i did actually lose a bit a weight the first few months while on it i will say the annoying part is minor fatty parts i cannot seem to get rid of that being my arms and upper backhormonal weight i have since gone vegan and exercise a bit more too	0	1	0	1
14316	"im 17 and have been on ocella for about 9 months if not more in terms of effectiveness i cant say i know because i use a condom every time i have sex
however it has done wonders for my acne and i havent had an increase in weight but ive noticed recently that whenever i have my period i end up being in a terrible mood i dont want anyone to talk to me or anything i want to cry im either pissed or i cry
another bad thing i noticed is my sex drive has gone way down im considering changing it but i need the pills for periods as well my periods are very irregular but i want to be on birth control since i am having sex"	0	1	0	1

14117	the nuvaring has been ok for me with the exception of making me feel like i have an uti on and off it has dramatically increased vaginal discharged and causes some itchiness i think this is what leads to the bladder irritation that feels like a uti ive also gotten some headaches and noticed some bloating around my abdomen all in all i am probably going off of the ring im scared of any birth control at this point they all have side effects	0	1	0	1

508	every womans experience with insertion is different i was not expecting much pain since i am used to severe cramping and i read others reviews but getting it inserted was the worst pain of my life i screamed in the drs officeand it felt unbearable like fire  shards of glass twisted inside i was shaken up for days after cramps and low energy for 15 weeks after insertion 2 week long periods 3 days preliletta cramps on and off for 2 months after insertion despite these side effects glad i got the liletta morning after pills were hard on my system when i forgot my birth control pills and getting my pills became difficult and expensive because of my insurance liletta  insertion was free for me which makes this a win	0	1	0	1

1668	"i used aubra for two functions as a contraceptive and as a way to reduce acne i would call it a positive experience since its main function was to reduce risk of pregnancy and i did not become pregnant while using it 
however there are side effects as with any oral contraceptive different pills use different kinds of synthetic hormones each of which may or may not have a different effect on the users skin
aubra is partly comprised of levonorgestrel which is one of the most androgenic acne causing synthetic hormones used in oral contraceptives

4389	i started using the nuvaring just yesterday and i have already noticed a dramatic change in my moods i quickly go from happy to sad to mad i felt like i was insane several hours after insertion hopefully i can get over the mood swings because other than that i believe the nuvaring was the best choice for me it doesnt hurt at all its easy to use and my partner said he felt it during sex but not enough to distract or bother him	0	1	0	1

169	after significant weight gain on depo and the implant i told my doctor how im sensitive to hormones more specifically  progesterone so this pill is considered low dose and is a mixture of progesterone and estrogen i decided tried it love the perks of clear skin and 15 pounds down in 5 months cons nausea after placebo week dark inner thighs mild depression and random head aches although i cant say there is a direct correlation between depression head aches and the pill open to try extra low dose and see how it works for me positives out weight negatives at this point	0	1	0	1

7953	this is a great birth control overall i had one period about a week after insertion and after that no more periods i didnt really make me moody or anything the only downside was that i was gaining weight about a pound a month and very difficult to lose after over a year on it and 15lbs later i began spotting for 3 weeks straight it didnt stop until i got it removed i got it removed for the weight issue not the spotting it would be perfect if it didnt make me gain weight i already lost a few lbs after getting it removed earlier this week	0	1	0	1

1026	so far i havent had any problems with apri at first my feet swelled a little bit and i was kind of bloated but that all went sway after the first pack ive had nexplanon which was the worst birth control i couldve ever got it cause so many health problems for me mostly stomach problems it made me lose a ton of weight which wasnt very healthy for a 15 year old i was on the depo shot and that made my moods crazy i have pretty bad anxiety already and the shot pretty much made it worse i dont take any medications for my anxiety because i dont believe i need to but i had to with the depo shot it made me gain about 15 pounds so im basically back to where i was 3 years ago before nexplanon apri has been the best for me yet	0	1	0	1

7304	so since after i took the pill and i was scared to death and read all these reviews i decided to leave mine to help someone on wednesday november 25th i had sex so while we were doing it we had a condom on  or so we thought he came inside of me fully as he pulled out he panicked because the condom fell completely off amp he just 100 came in me so we rushed out and spent 60 dollars on the pill i took the pill an hour after intercourse and did a whole bunch of research on the pill lets just say a week later after  after almost ripping my hair out im not pregnant i got my period they say the pill may make your period come a week early or late even though the pill is very expensive its 100 worth it so dont stress it	0	1	0	1
3848	most of these reviews arent so good and most of the reviewers arent giving their body enough time to adjust to the hormones your body is trying to get used to the pill so thats why during the first month you may get some unpleasant side effects like mood swing and acne i had nightmares for the first 3 weeks sore breasts after that and acne breakouts my first period on cryselle was horrible the cramps were awful but everyones different im still going to give my body the opportunity to adjust to cryselle if youre having some unpleasant side effects while on cryselle talk to your doctor especially if its something serious but dont be quick to give up the pill because of things like acne and sore breasts things can improve	0	1	0	1
15687	this birth control is wonderful because i never have cramps i used to have them so bad that i would throw up  i rarely have acne ive never had worse than very mild acne before though  my boobs grew big boobs run in my family  but it gives me constant yeast infectionsi shower daily sometimes twice and wear full coverage underwear and this doesnt make a difference  i will be switching soon no mood swings either	0	1	0	1

7364	"i have been on levora for 2 months now  i was on orthocyclen prior and was switched due to changes in my daily medication regimen  about 1 week into starting the pack i noticed that i am ravenously hungry all the time  it is similar to when i was pregnant  

ive also suffered from increased acne on my face  this could be from stress but ive never had a problem until starting levora

probably the most distressing side effect ive experienced is a marked decrease in my libido  suffice to say that i enjoyed my intimate moments prior to starting this medication  now sexual encounters are uncomfortable vaginal dryness and few and far between complete change from where i was  the quotbig oquot is harder to achieve too"	0	1	0	1
