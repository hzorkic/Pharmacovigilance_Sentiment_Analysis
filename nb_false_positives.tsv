6376	ive had skyla for almost two years and im very iffy on how i feel towards it the insertion wasnt bad just a big cramp my period used to be only a few days very heavy and i never had cramps with skyla i have light spotting that lasts twice as long with some pretty terrible cramps and nausea the week before i get the spotting i have extreme cravings and gain like five pounds and then lose it all right away from barely eating the week i spot i used to struggle with acne and now my skin is always clear my spouse is sometimes jabbed by the strings i didnt want something with a lot of hormones so i chose skyla over other forms of birth control but i feel like the cons may outweigh the pros for me	1	0	1	0
2169	i had my liletta put in on may 3rd this year keep in mind ive never had children or been pregnant during insertion i felt the most intense pain i had ever experienced before i was one of the few that went into quotshockquot after having it put in my cramps lasted the entire time i had it in and i had painful intercourse as well i recently took it out myself and already feel a ton better when i pulled the iud out i noticed it was crooked instead of in a t shape i am one of the few to have a bad experience but please talk to your doctor about it if you have any issues	1	0	1	0
5459	im an army wife and the clinic here switched me too this birth control after 3 years of a different pill well after a couple months ive experienced longer periods a depleted sex drive and a harder to reach climax i am not happy since my husband just got back from iraq and we should be having the best sex right now 	1	0	1	0
17989	i have been on and off several birth control medications for several years this is my first bad experience i was originally put on ortho tricyclen then ortho tricyclen lo then sprintec then something else but since i have been on trinessa i have yet to stop bleeding i started the first day of my period had my regular period for my usual 7 days and have had continued spotting heavily everyday since now going on my third week as far as birth control is concerned very effective since i havent been able to have sex since i started taking it not exactly my idea of great birth control 	1	0	1	0
2714	was put on this pill after i came off microgynon after 5 years as it made me insane ive been on loestrin for 3 months and will be changing as soon as i can i have been having the most severe nightmares on this pill and i am woken up every night in a tizz also my boobs have grown a cup size which is good but i have also gained weight and cant seem to shift it feel constantly fat also all my life i have had essentially perfect skin but since being on this pill my skin is constantly greasy which has resulted into spots on the plus side mood is generally good and no pregnancys but the nightmares are too big of a deal to carry on	1	0	1	0
11472	ive had nexplanon for 7 months and have been bleeding almost every day for 6 of those months the bleeding is light but enough to wear a tampon so its consistently annoying on the plus side once your body gets used to nexplanon you forget its in your arm and im also not pregnant which at the end of the day is its job i have 3 friends who tried nexplanon and it worked for 2 of them theyre both on their second ones before trying it be aware that some insurances will not pay for you to get it removed if you want it out before the 3 years is up so make sure you check with them in case it doesnt work i do think it was worth the try and would be willing to try it again in the future but it definitely is still quite flawed	1	0	1	0
5925	i get a lot of breakthrough bleeding and not just spotting i was on lo seasonal and i should have just stayed on that but i was wanting more of a long term birth control my sex drive didnt go down but i feel as if im in a race with my body to see if i can have sex before i start bleeding again no weight gain or mood swings though ive actually lost 5 pounds	1	0	1	0

12146	ive had the nexplanon in since december i got my period a week after and i still have my period and its almost may i feel hungry all the time and it has made me break out and left red little scars on my face because the breakouts were so bad in the beginning but they have calmed down now i have gained a little weight also other than that it has saved me from getting pregnant a few times but there are to many side effects	1	0	1	0
10989	i had the mirena inserted 6 weeks after giving birth to my 3rd baby in august 2011 i had also had it for a year after the birth of my 2nd baby inserting the mirena has never been a painful experience in either time i had it put in maybe because i had it put in after childbirth im not sure but i spotted off and on for 6 months same as the other time then my periods stopped completely for 8 months i had no side effects for my first year which was wonderful until oct 2012 i was spotting a little heavy for 2 weeks i started having cramps backaches nausea headaches i felt like i was pregnant which happened the first time i was on mirena i was too uncomfortable and had it removed today by the obgyn not using this method again	1	0	1	0

1202	when i first started taking beyaz it was great i had no problems but towards the end of the cycle i had terrible attitude was very emotional nauseous and too many headaches once my period was gone it came back a day after and it was light to medium very bad cramps my appetite increased a lot more when i started but everyones body is different and would react different to the pills	1	0	1	0
17899	i started trinessa about 2 months ago while visiting familyvthe 1st day was seemingly perfect my period ended within hours of taking it then the 2nd day we went to the water park and i was attacked by a horrible bout of nausea i ended up vomiting at the water park then 2 more times later that afternoon i took it the next day and 4 more days following and threw up 3 times each day about 4 hours after taking the dosage i had no choice but to quit taking it i couldnt handle the nausea and ongoing sickness 	1	0	1	0
5284	im 18 and i got my implanon inserted about a month ago i got my period which was 45 days long it was very light and i had no pains this was great for me as i usually suffer with heavy very painful periods but the downside to this is i have been getting very emotional and moody lately im hoping this will wear off soon as it can get in the way of things but i still have a long way to go so hopefully it will all work out for the best	1	0	1	0
5013	this is the first time being on birth control ive been on the pill for 3 months i am 52 and i was 130lbs before now im 150lbs i dont have mood swings and my sex drive is still pretty high and my skin looks amazing  overall the pill does its job	1	0	1	0
12858	ill start with the pros ive had nexplanon for almost 2 years and in terms of effectiveness its amazing it definitely does its job at preventing pregnancy i had pretty light periods to begin with so almost immediately after starting nexplanon my period went away completely i also dont ever have to worry about taking the pill like i had before which is great now for the cons since ive had nexplanon ive gained a lot of weight i started at 125 and am now 150 which is pretty significant i think my anxiety has also been off the charts crazy since the first day i got it in other than that id say the pros out weigh the cons but currently im looking into a nonhormonal option just to see if this was truly causing my weight gain	1	0	1	0
2325	my periods were for 7 or 8 days and i was moody and emotional and made my boyfriend insane  i think it made my hormones go crazy  i was mean and angry for a whole week  	1	0	1	0
4985	this birth control had its pros and its cons with this birth control i knew exactly when i would start my period and what day i would get off my period it was like clockwork that never seemed to fail my period was a tad shorter and it was definitely lighter overall aside from the first day this bc didnt do much for my cramps i didnt have any side effects such as moodiness or weight gain that i seemed to notice my reason for getting off this bc though is because it made me breakout like crazy before i rarely had so much as a pimple with this bc i didnt feel comfortable going out without makeup because my complexion got so bad	1	0	1	0
8465	i have been using loestrin 24 fe for 7 months i love the fact that my periods are a lot lighter because lord knows i had the longest most painful periods ever my breasts have grown a whole cup size and they feel as though they might keep growing i love the weight in my breasts but i have gained 5 pounds and i eat the same if not better than before i got on the pill and i exercise just as much so im considering stopping the pill and switching to another method of birth control because weight gain and me do not mix well i have had a large amount of spot bleeding it has decreased as the months have gone on other than the weight gain this pill has been my best fiend so if it doesnt seem to make you gain weight i would say it is the best	1	0	1	0
5888	ive been on the ring for about 2 years and i love the ease of it but dont like the decrease in sex drive its non existent and the increase in breast size i have implantsdont need them larger ive been crazy moody also which i didnt really attribute to this until after reading the reviews  im switching back to pills to see if it really was the ring or not	1	0	1	0
6880	lasted 75mo started july 2015 first couple months spotted every couple of days and spotty acne started period was normal for sept but then was nonstop for all four weeks of oct serious acne formed into rough patches all over my face my hair thinned out to maybe half thickness doctor said this is all still normal because its the first time in 13 years im without a daily estrogen dose so its normal to have pregnancylike symptoms normal period in nov two week period in december skin improving after help from dermatologist january i had three separate instances of facial abscesses as in dimesized open infections on my face also my january period lasted for 6 weeks until i had it removed in february awful cramps too	1	0	1	0
98	"after 2 months on the generic form of this pill my doctor suggested i move to loestrin it seemed pretty awesome because for the 3 months i was on it i had no periods or cramps i did experience weight gain breast tenderness major mood swings loss of libido and slight increase in acne personally i loved not having periods it was cool and it saved me money on tampons but the lack of sex drive was enough to convince me and my doctor that this wasnt the birth control for me ive switched to ortho tricyclen and lost the 7 pounds i had gained in the 3 months i was on loestrin im cramping and having periods again but my sex drive is back at a decent level and my emotions are better in check 

dont be afraid to switch birth controls"	1	0	1	0
5128	its a great birth control but only because i have had a heavy period that my doctor is prescribing me birth control pills for so i am not having any sex with my husband no one told me i wouldnt stop having a period	1	0	1	0
11423	"i had nexplanon for 45 years my first one was great aside from hurting when they put it in and skin sensitivity at the insertion point for about a month it was great birth control its more effective than tubal ligation and you dont have to remember to take any pills you cant get baby fever and decide to stop taking birth control its temporarily permanent

i had the first implant removed at 3 years and had my 2nd one inserted it was placed deeper in my arm than the first one no skin sensitivity but from insertion i had so many side effects with the second one weight gain periods that would last 10 days every 46 weeks random brown spotting mood swings hormonal acne got it removed hallelujah"	1	0	1	0
14237	"hi everyone just wanted to share my 8 months experience with nuvaring
first i was really happy  it helps with my heavy and painful periods for sure
unfortunately my libido went to zero and even if i took the ring out intercourse was really painfullike sharp razor blades
also suffered from horrible migraines almost everyday be careful when you use 1 combines hormones
my neurologist who i saw for my chronics migraines suggest me to take off the ring and see if my migraine will get better

16703	i got skyla on august 23 the doctor gave me ibuprofen about 10 mintues before so she went in with 1 swab of numbing cream and 2 shots it took her awhile to insert it because i wasnt dilated all the way it didnt hurt that bad during the procedure when the procedure was done they had me lay on my side and i was turning pale and cramping alot afterwards i asked if i could get up and go to the restroom so i got up and the doctor asked if i was okay i said no i feel like im going to faint next thing i know im on the ground with the doctor beside me when i came back into the room a laid down somemore until my mom got in the room i was begging to leave that instant but they wouldnt let me go because the cramps were so bad i couldnt go to school for the rest of the day its september 22 and ive been cramping and bleeding everyday since ive been hot all the time and ive been eating more than usual	1	0	1	0
2562	i have been on aleese for 8 years this birth control is great for preventing pregnancy and regulating my menstrual cycle it also helped my menstrual cycle be lighter unfortunately this birth control does lower your sex drive i went off it and my sex drive came back full force and plan to go off it permanently	1	0	1	0
5647	i have had the implant since february of this year despite the decent prevention it has hindered my sex drive greatly i have also gained weight i was never able to do that before on any type of bc i went from 163 to 189 pounds this actually bothers me  since i didnt change anything in what i do or eat if i keep gaining like this i may have it removed at the one year	1	0	1	0

4670	i wanted to try this because pills just were not working for me and i decided a nonhormonal iud would be my best bet insertion was pretty painful and i had to rest for around 15 minutes before i could actually stand up and walk i have had it for 3 months now and i am a person that will try something for as long as possible before i have had enough lower back pain painful cramps period that lasts 2 weeks where i bleed through super tampons in two hours and spotting for the other 2 weeks crouching down for longer then 30 seconds as well as sitting on hard chairs means having painful cramps for the day for this much pain not worth it does prevent pregnancy though	1	0	1	0
4036	i tried this for about 4 months and at first it seemed to work fine but then i started spotting almost all the time and my periods began to become irregular and lasted a for days longer with more intense cramps than i used to have it also did make me a little bit more moody but not drastically so i decided to have the rod removed because i dont like being so irregular and dealing with cramps that are more intense than the intense cramps i usually experienced without birth control im not sure how it worked for me when it comes to preventing pregnancy since i got this to begin birth control before getting married and have yet to marry my fiance and so on this may work for other women but unfortunately it wasnt the best fit for m	1	0	1	0
11507	ive had this birth control for the full 3 years as of december 2015 my doctor informed me that i would have little to no bleeding i would bleed from 3 to 6 months at a time when it was brought to my drs attention she advised me to give it time yes it prevented pregnancy but what they shouldve said was that you wouldnt be having sex enough to get pregnant i wouldnt be so terrible if it was light spotting but it was heavy the entire time a little tmi it was suppose to help with my clotting but onlyl gotten worse ive finally taken my sisters advice to get a new doctor but i will not recommend this form of contraception to anyone everyones experience is different i would strongly do research about all of your options firs	1	0	1	0
7923	this is the only birth control ive ever been on so i dont have a point of comparison but i dont think its helpful at all i started it because i was having periods every two weeks for about 2 months im in my third month of taking it and not only do i still randomly get my period in the middle of the month but if i am so much as 5 minutes early or late taking the pill in the morning ill get my period again i already had depression and it made it so much worse than it already was that i had to go back into therapy acne is no better or worse i guess the only thing it did right was that it sort of made my cramps better and then not to mention the fact that even after insurance its still 50 which i cant afford every month	1	0	1	0
2569	i have been on apri for a year and was recently put on another then forced back do to a recall i was so sad to be put back on apri while off for 2 months my weight had gone down and sex drive went back to normal and i head energy again now back on for not even a month and everything is getting messed up again its not the pills fault but you may notice weight gain feel sluggish and a lower sex drive if your body reacts to this the same way i do  its time to figure out something else my body and relationship cant go thu this again	1	0	1	0
9931	i took this for over 3 yrs age 17 to almost 21 and wish id read reviews and realized what was happening to me sooner ive always been a nervous person but my anxiety went through the roof on this pill however i blamed the anxiety on getting older and maybe the stress of school in hindsight it was definitely the pill i changed from a happy easygoing person to an emotional monster i became easily infuriated and even hit my boyfriend out of rage something i would never normally do i gained weight had acne and became unbelievably moody stopping this pill was the best decision and i only wish id never started my advice is to not take this pill but if you choose to be aware of how your body is reacting i wish i had sooner	1	0	1	0
17139	i started taking sprintec almost 3 months ago the first week i took the active pills i was am fine no spotting but for the 2nd and 3rd weeks i am spottingbleeding until the inactive pills i dont know if i can stand continuing to take it	1	0	1	0
13695	i am torn by the nuvaring the convenience is great there is no daily time to take a pill only once a month which can easily be marked on a calender or put into a phone it never falls out i never feel it and changing it is simple too i would give the nuvaring a 10 out of 10 just based upon the simplicity and the price is really reasonable too but there are some downsides for me personally for the first few months i did not notice side effects although they are there i have a very low tolerance to alcohol when on the nuvaring very emotional tired and strung out all the time i was on the pill before and none of these happened i also have longer periods its worth a try every girl seems to have a different experience	1	0	1	0
2856	at first i loved this birth control i used to have a heavy period with loads of cramps then i got on this and had no cramps and very little bleeding the only downfall of this was after a week or two on it my breakouts became very bad i have really sensitive skin so this could be because of that but also ive read other reviews and acne was a side effect of this specific type	1	0	1	0
1837	im 19 and ive been on aviane for 8 days now i switched from diane 35 i never experienced side effects while on my old pill but i had to change pills because the other one has more estrogen and is also for acne which i dont have much of anymore since being on aviane ive been having cramps very often ive been feeling nauseous and yesterday i vomited i also felt very tired for a few days even though i had slept over 10 hours the previous nights on the plus side it hasnt affected my skin and my sex drive is normal ill see how i feel by the end of the month	1	0	1	0
12715	i have been on nexplanon for about 5 months now and i like it as far a proctection from getting pregnant but not as far as the hormone changes i get very bad mood swings i also get depressed sometimes the worst part is i get very bad acne i have never had this issue and now one side of my face looks very ugly they may want to chnge the hormone effects with this considering acne problems it has also started acne on my back as well my boyfriend hates it and so do i	1	0	1	0
5223	i would have given this a higher rating as i used to love this pill i went through 3 months in the beginning of irregular periods which i knew would happen and once that was over these worked beautifully no mood changes no weight changes regulated my period for months and now ive been on it for a year maybe and for the past 2 months ive had my normal period and then another period 2 weeks into the new pack of pills in 2 months i had 4 periods then the next month it was regulated and now again 2 weeks into the pill i am spotting again this is ridiculous 	1	0	1	0

12220	i first got the implant when it was called implanon from 022012022015 that experience was great hardly any periods did gain weight but i didnt really care because i have horrible long painful periods anyway i got in replaced and my obgyn told me that nexplanon was the new name and quota little differentquot  my periods came back and with a vengeance i have constant weeks of excruciating cramping with maybe 2 day breaks in between it drives my boyfriend insane of course im debating on taking it out but it has kept me from getting pregnant literally the only perk	1	0	1	0
5528	the first 4 months was putting on weight and mood swings which i did not enjoy i love not having to use a condom but the implant has loads of side effects and the most annoying one is all along on a period i think thats the reason you dont get pregnant with the implant	1	0	1	0
14303	"im gonna keep it short and sweet ive been on about a week taking it to help with pms no initial symptoms other than slight increase in random emotional upheaval
after about 3 days exhaustion kicked in along with unnecessary bursts of anger frustration or sadness
46 days mass fatigue appalling headaches i promise you im not exaggerating crazy outbreaks of spots nausea and lightheadedness
im going to stick it through for at least another week and will update i would obviously prefer to follow through see if it settles down but i have rather a lot to do in the next few months and would rather not be impeded by my hormones
good luck its worth a try you can always take it out if it disagrees with you

18267	first pill i tried it didnt really give me noticeable side effects but not many benefits besides no pregnancy it didnt decrease cramps by much i still got wicked headaches that would make me nauseous and it decreased my sex drive over all when i stopped taking it i felt like i had come out of a fog as if the pill had been dulling senses beyond just my sex drive happier to be on sprintec now	1	0	1	0
9073	i was on the depo for two years and was awesome for the first 6 months i seriously thought i was in heaven i still had periods but had absolutely no cramps at all which is saying a lot since i had horrible pains before and the bleeding was light i started the depo because i couldnt remember the pill things were going well and then i started a period that lasted for a year i would have stayed on the depo regardless of the bleeding but it was the horrible mood swings that made me stop using it i was seriously a miserable person though this was my experience it could be different for others my body never reacts the way it should really the only way to know is to try it yourself	1	0	1	0
5516	i have had implanon for just over a year although its a great bc i have had no weight gain or mood swings which i like but i do not stop bleeding its so irregular i still have no pattern i am currently stuck in a 2 week period and starting to get bad cramping when i first got it i had a 3 week period it seemed to be fine and then its just changed again also my skin has turned into a teen in puberty 	1	0	1	0
12814	so i had nexplanon for a little over a year at first i really liked it because i loved not having to think about my birth control and i didnt seem to have any of the negative side effects however after 6months i noticed a drastic increase in weight gain and crying whenever stressed which was not an issue before i waited to see if it would subside but then i started breaking out and i just kept gaining weight even with dietary changes over the last few months did not work for me but of course try it out yourself as other people have great results as for the procedure itself it never hurt just some soreness for a week or 2 after and you forget its there taking it out did not hurt just the numbness injection	1	0	1	0
1412	i was on nuvaring and i loved it until a year and a half into when i started bleeding during sex thats how i knew i had to get off it when i was on the pill that happened too and as soon as i switched to something else i was fine im not sure if thats just because my body gets used to birth controls after about a year and a half and starts acting up on them	1	0	1	0

2012	i had been on the depo since a young age due to my periods landing me in the er each month because of vomiting my body amp depo worked well together so i was disappointed when my gyno recommended me switch to something lighter skyla it was insertion was painful but over quickly the after effects are what took me down fainting vomiting unreal cramping by the time i got to the car amp whole first day nausea amp cramps the next week now i just cramp terribly all the time every day for 2 months that being said i am thrilled to have mine removed tomorrow my experience will not be yours but i do recommend hearing other stories so you can be prepared but do not fear iuds or your insertion process each woman will have her own experience	1	0	1	0

9278	i was on depo for about 5 years my period would immediatly stop everytime i took the shot that is the only positive aside from that i gained about 30 pounds from the shot thank god i was really small when i got on it  and my fat is in the quot rightquot places however it doesnt change the fact that this is something that should not be on the market doctors will tell you that it is your diet that is causing the weight gain however my diet is the same as it was years ago i decided to get off the shot  as getting a period is a part of woman hood and not enough of a reason to keep injecting something that awful in my body i have been off about 6 months now thankfully my periods are regular now but i plan to see a dietician soon	1	0	1	0

the good  my cramps are now minimal if they happen at all  the heavy bleeding is no longer an issue and my periods are regular  i have no issues with the patch falling off  i shower daily as well as exercise and this seems to have no effect on the adhesion
the bad  after 12 hours of wear or less the patch becomes very itchy  i try to resist the urge to scratch but it gets to the point where it feels like my skin is on fire
the ugly  the patch leaves a red rash where it was applied to the skin  sometimes it will create a weeping wound with blisters

17702	well i took tri sprintec for a couple of months no problems then i stopped taking it for a month got back on it its been almost a month since ive been back on it and the first week i was bloated to where it was uncomfortable starting peeing a lot felt very nausea for 2 weeks to where it would keep me up at night after the nausea went away my boobs felt a little sore but those symptoms slowly went away the only big problem i have with it now is that its making me obsess over my stomach im naturally skinny and its made me gain so much weight and on top of that im still extremely bloated its really making me really upset thinking about changing bc havent had my period this month yet should start next week	1	0	1	0
17757	being a 1st time user of birth control i was hesitant im very fearful of the side effects that come with all birthcontrols like heart attack and stroke but after a brief discussion with my doctor i realized the pros out weighed the cons and was willing to give trisprintec a shot im not sexually active so my biggest concern isnt getting pregnant however i have moderate acne which ive tried treating with prescriptions and over the counter medicines i also suffer with pmdd which has made my life miserable since i was 14 since ive completed my 2nd week of pills i must say i am overjoyed no pmdd complications and my acne is getting better as far as side effect i did have headaches the 1st 3 days every thing else has been smooth	1	0	1	0

8492	"overall the reason that i am switching from loestrin24fe is because my body needs different levels of progestin lower and estrogen higher this was the first birth control pill that i had ever taken and i had many problems with irregular bleeding which in turn lead to severe anemia other minor side effects were some mood swings the first month and i did gain weight in my breasts during the 3 months i was on loestrin i didnt have any problems with nausea outside the first week which maybe could be attributed to other factors it was also very expensive 8700mo with no insurance

11841	i went on nexplanon after experiencing depression and crying spells while on numerous birth control pills i was happy that nexplanon is very convenient because you dont need to remember to take it each day like the pills however i have a history of cystic acne and went on accutane several years ago around the second month of being on nexplanon i was breaking out on my shoulders and neck which are areas that i havent broken out in for years i also had a lot more breakouts on my face i noticed that my skin was much more oily as well i would not recommend this to anyone who has struggled with acne in the past or is currently struggling with it	1	0	1	0

11919	while it is effective in that i have not gotten pregnant it has not been an overall positive experience for me since getting nexplanon 3 months ago my period has come about every week and a half and then between the periods im almost constantly spotting i called to see about having it removed but the doctor said that many women stop getting their periods after the first six months so she advised that i wait until the end of the year to remove it if im still spotting and having these miserable periods by the end of the year i will definitely get it removed although i am hoping they stop so i can keep it because i like not having to worry about getting pregnant or needing onhand contraception with me it takes away the worry factor	1	0	1	0

2375	i have a hard time rating this because my feelings are mixed i naturally have emotionally high highs and low lows when not on any birth control on this pill the emotions have somewhat leveled out though not as much as they did on yaz and maybe not enough the real down side is a severely decreased sex drive same response on yaz and its affecting my relationship with my boyfriend i cant attribute my breast growth skin clearing or weight gain to aviane  all due to other factors i take aviane at night to sleep through the nausea same on yaz if i miss a pill and have to take 2 it will make me vomit but taking 1 pill each night as prescribed makes it manageable i dont want to shop around but maybe aviane is not the pill for me	1	0	1	0

8393	im almost finished with my first sample pack of loestrin 24 and so far so good the only thing im not comfortable with is the brown discharge that ive been having the whole time but im positive its only because my body has to adjust this is my first birth control brand and im hoping for the best i took the brown tablets two days ago and it feels like a normal period as far as cramps goes its hard to tell whether im experiencing insomnia because im on summer vacation and stay up until 3am regardless so far i cant complain but i do feel a little moodier breasts increased size which im completely fine with i havent noticed any weight gain but i wouldnt mind it well see how it goes for the second pack	1	0	1	0

4585	i believe this is the best birth control ive tried that prevents pregnancy because after 9 months of having it i have gained weight had mood swings and have no sex drive to even want to have sex i recommend this to someone that truly wants to prevent pregnancy and is serious about just that and be okay with the side effects for myself im about to research different ones because this one isnt for me	1	0	1	0
