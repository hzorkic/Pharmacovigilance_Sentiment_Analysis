0.0,"I am desperate to get this implant out.
It has given me anxiety, loss of sex drive, mood changes, dizziness. I have also got acne from it and gained 3 stone on weight. My doctor persuaded me to keep it in last time I tried having it taken out.
So have had it in 2.5 years. I have an appointment for it to be taken out tomorrow. Never again!"
0.0,"The first time I got the Nexplanon implant I had severe mood swings and dangerous bouts of depression every day for 3 months. I was angry, every little thing set me off and I would emotionally breakdown and cry constantly for no discernible reason. It calmed down after a few months of absolute mental torture, but now I've had my implant replaced with a fresh Nexplanon the symptoms have come back with force. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, especially those with depression/suicidal tendencies already. It just amplifies all of your negative and dangerous feelings. A terrible and mentally damaging product. 0/10z"
0.0,"I definitely agree with everyone here saying that Nexplanon has altered their moods and has affected them mentally as well. I have been on it for a year or so and holy moly has this been an emotional roller coaster for me. I already struggle with depression but has definitely increased with this and also has lead to more suicidal thoughts. I don’t feel like myself, mind is always foggy, and I constantly feel numb, wanting to push everyone away. This all couldn’t even be related to the implant but it has for sure gotten worse ever since I got it inserted. Did I also mention the weight gain that comes with it? I know it is different for everyone and studies can’t back up this evidence but I seriously believe it has something to do with the implant. I had lost weight easily before but now I find myself constantly craving more food and is harder for me to lose. This hasn’t been a good experience for me so far. I can’t wait to make an appointment to take it out ASAP."
0.0,"I had Nexplanon for for 6 months because a friend recommended it. I got it taken out four days ago. I struggle a little with anxiety and depression but they skyrocketed on Nexplanon. I had several bouts of crying that were so severe, I collapsed on my kitchen floor. One night, I was crying so hard for so many hours I thought that I would have to go to the hospital for psychiatric help. 
I struggled terribly with intrusive, obsessive thoughts. I was paranoid that my boyfriend was cheating on me or talking to other women and I couldn't get the thoughts out of my mind. (He's not doing any of those things and he's a good man whom I trust completely.) I just became obsessed and paranoid about various 'stories' that my mind was telling me. I was irritable and anxious and miserable. 
My sex drive was okay, certainly less than normal, but the vaginal dryness was surprising too. 
I can't wait until more forms of male birth control are approved because these methods for women are not helpful."
0.0,"I got nexplannon in 2020 at some point. I have always had anxiety but never this bad. it gets to the point where I feel like I'm going to pass out or as if nothing is real. My hair will not grow. I am soo moody and I start fights 24/7 with my fiancé. at first everything was fine but after a couple years I am ready to rip this out of my arm. I have an appointment in a couple days to get it out. Getting this was the worst decision ever and I don't recommend this to anyone. I have

1.0,"Nexplanon was the first birth control I was on and overall it was a decent experience. I could've been a lot worse but could've been a little better. First of all, it did it's job-- I never got pregnant! As far as side effects.  I probably gained about 6 or 7 pounds but I expected that since I got it when I was 18 and my body was just changing. It made me feel bloated here and there but that's to be expected too. I'm also on anxiety medicine and I don't think it ever interfered with that at all. Sure I'd have days where my anxiety was worse than others but I don't think it was directly caused by Nexplanon. I also had some issues with acne here and there but nothing that I couldn't manage (again, I'm not sure if it's because of the Nexplanon). Now I will say... going off Nexplanon was a bit of a pain. It made me feel off for about a month, but I expected that as well. It's like going off of any kind of medicine...your body's gonna feel wonky for a while. Overall, not a bad experience."
0.0,"I had the nexplanon put in years ago and the whole 9 months I had it I had no period (yay). But I felt crazy, I couldn't control my moods and it was affecting my relationships, honestly I felt relieved just days after having it removed. Fast forward 4/5 years and I decided to try it again after having 2 kids in 2 years. I had it inserted Nov 2021, I had the most painful period I'd had in years 2 weeks after insertion as well as panic attacks (I haven't had panic attacks in at least 5 years!). Since about January (2 months after insertion) I just don't feel like myself anymore. My relationship is suffering even more so because i have completely lost my sex drive, I don't have as much patience as I normally do, I honestly feel like I'm going crazy, I haven't had it removed yet as I was waiting to see if maybe it was something else (health anxiety around covid etc maybe?). I've been trying to rule out other possible causes but after reading this forum I can say I believe it is the nexplanon."
0.0,"I just turned 15 when I got the nexplanon. I never wanted the implant but it was literally the only option my mom gave me, so I got it. I was on my period when I got it placed and my period didn’t go away. After I bled for 3 months I went back to the doctor and she gave me bc pills to take alongside the nexplanon. It stopped the bleeding but my doc wouldn’t let me stay on the pills. I started bleeding again and it didn’t stop. I started to notice I was having low blood sugars and feeling sick after I ate. I got the nexplanon taken out after being on it for 7 months and a month later I was diagnosed with type one diabetes (autoimmune disease). What’s crazy is the nexplanon can cause higher blood sugars and I told my doctor my family had a history of diabetes and other autoimmune diseases but she still put me on it without trying to show there was other options and/or non hormonal birth control options. The implant is very hit or miss. But personally I didn't like it."
1.0,"I’m not sure how to feel about it. It’s just my second month with it so I will maybe try it one more month.  Insertion was not bad! The numbing shot was painful- but after that it was easy. I bruise easily so had a bruise around it but after 2-3 weeks it was gone. Arm hurt for a couple days but was fine after that. 
I get nauseous every once in a while but not badly and maybe just once a week. I’ve been spotting on and off for almost two months now. Which is super annoying. If this doesn’t go away next month then I’ll just get it removed. 
The thing that bothers me right now is the anxiety!!! My mind is in hyperdrive. I’m super sensitive and irrational. I haven’t been able to sleep well. 
I’m having a follow up next month and if this doesn’t get better I’m taking it out. 
The nurse was really nice when I asked questions at insertion. She told me everyone reacts differently so to be aware of how it makes me feel and we can check back at the follow up."
0.0,Okay so I got nexplanon in back in November of 2021. Was tired of the pills I couldn’t remember to take them. December was fine I didn’t get my period was happy. (I only got my period once light spotting for 3 days) January was when symptoms started. I would have nausea after eating. I would have extreme anxiety over studying (which is normal usual but not extreme) this was heightened anxiety. February came and BAM! My symptoms got worse anxiety attacks about my health and a fixation on getting chronically ill. The paranoia around my health was absurd. Finally pieced it together when I went to a doctor who recognized my symptoms. Validated my feelings and reassured me. She fast tracked me to get this birth control out of me! I’m getting it out in 7 days and I’m literally counting the days. I only lasted 4 months. So please don’t get this birth control the mental health issues are not worth it.
0.0,"Let me start off by saying. Nexplanon ruined my life. Before I got the implant in my arm I was active, happy, confident, energetic, SKINNY. I used to go to the gym 5 days a week and was very active. I have had this thing in my arm for about a year now and I have gained 30+ pounds. I hold myself to a very high standard when it comes to my appearance and my health. When I look in the mirror I don't recognize myself- and the worst part is, I cannot do anything about it because Nexplanon has drained me of any motivation I have to get out of bed.. let alone workout or be active. I cannot even convince myself to go for a walk. I haven't been to the gym in months and it used to be favorite place Monday-Friday. Not only has it compromised my health and my appearance, it has totally destroyed my mental health. Because of Nexplanon I have had EXTREME anxiety, to the point of pushing my loved ones away. It ruined my life. Getting it removed in 2 weeks and I couldn't be happier."
0.0,"This is my second time trying Nexplanon and I regret it once again. It affects my daily mood and have me thinking I am insane. I literally catch myself crying every day. Most days I feel very depressed, and don’t want to get out the bed.  It even affects the way I feel as though I treat my 2 year old daughter. I am grateful for my daughter, but sometimes I have no energy to be a mother. Let’s not talk about the bleeding. I think the reason I be so miserable is because I’m always BLEEDING. I try not to get excited when I’m not on my period, bc I know it will come back on within a day. Please avoid this birth control !!"
0.0,"This is the worst birth control I have ever had!! I do not recommend it to anybody. The first couple of months was fine and I didn’t have a period at all. But after that, I bled every single day. Sometimes I would stop bleed for like a week and then the bleeding would start back up again. So I went to a different OBGYN and he had said he also does not recommend anyone having this birth control. -1000/10 would not recommend it"
0.0,"I had my expired nexplanon in my arm for more than 2 years ago and ever since I have not  not got pregnant. Now I always have period, low sex drive, pain in my chest back and always having serious headache all the time.  I also have breast discharge, dizziness, weight gain, bloating and also smelly urine. I hope this effect will not affect me in the future.  The fact that this nexplanon had be out to me it is not advisable"
0.0,"I had the implant inserted on a Wednesday afternoon to help me stop ovulating due to severe pain. My arm was sore and numb for the first day, the second day still sore and painful but burning started in the implant area. The 3rd day my arm became more painful than the day it was inserted, it was burning all up and down my arm, I was unable to touch under my arms it would burn terrible. The 4th day I called the OB and was told to see someone in office the following day, around 3pm I was delusional, vomiting, my BP was through the roof, I couldn’t open my eyes . . My husband took me to the ER. I had it removed and was given nausea meds and Benadryl to calm me down since my heart rate was so high. I am 3 days post removal and I feel like I have the Flu. I would never recommend this to anyone, do research!"
0.0,"This is like a psychiatric drug that will ruin your whole day or until you have this implant on. I can’t explain the trauma that I suffered with this thing on. I had it for less than 2 months. First month I had no symptoms and no period. I started to bleed on the 2nd month and that’s when I started to have panic attacks, anxiety. I ended up in the ER twice thinking I am having a heart attack. I felt my chest burning, I felt my heart rate increasing and beating so fast that I could hear it. I felt like I had some disease that I will die soon. I was constantly living under fear. I didn’t even want to do anything. I felt like something is happening to my body. I couldn’t even look after my kids or smile or talk to anyone. This is a nightmare. Please don’t get it. There are plenty of other options. I gotten it removed today and I started to feel myself again, I am still getting scared but it’s lessening now."
1.0,"I love this BC. I’ve been on it nearly a year, no issues, no periods, no weight gain. My prior BC had my blood pressure at a dangerous level. It has since levelled out. I often forget it is in there. No complaints."
0.0,"Nexplanon was the only birth control that fit my needs and lifestyle so I ignored the terrible side effects for a long time but they're awful. 
The good: I only get my period about once every 3 months and it's been extremely effective at preventing pregnancy. Ease of use is great--they implant it and I don't have to think about it again for a few years. 
But the cons: for context, I used to have a very manageable period. 4 days on average with little to no cramping and zero PMS symptoms. Now, about once every 3 months, my depression (which might be related to the implant) reaches an extreme where I have no will to continue on. Then like clockwork, my period arrives. It lasts 2 weeks minimum and while it is fairly light most days, I have cramping every single day. After my period finally ends, which is very unpredictable, my emotions become more manageable, though I'm still fairly depressed and anxious, which was never as big an issue before. I've also gained a lot of weight."
1.0,"I’ve been on this method of contraception since I was 14 & I’m 28 this year. This implant works so well for me. I rarely ever get a period, I don’t get spots, I’ve always stayed the same weight, I’m quite a happy person. The only downside is removal as I hate needles but it’s never that bad once it’s over with. Will probably continue to use this until the menopause :)"
0.0,"Nexplanon caused me to have crawling sensations on my scalp and all over my body. I had anxiety and get really nervous staying at home by myself.

I thought I was going crazy, and I never thought it could be the implant.

I had the implant in for over a year and I experienced the weird sensations for close to a year. I did everything I could, from acupuncture, to vitamins, to starting HRT. On an inkling, I asked my doctor to remove it and everything stopped.

But after those 4 months I began having periods again, except they were two a month - very painful and heavier than my usual periods which were already heavy too. After a few months of this, my periods became really irregular. As of I’d say Dec/Jan 2022 I have had horrible mood swings, body aches, headaches when I wake up. My mood swings have been really getting to me. I will randomly snap at my boyfriend who I love for seemingly nothing, and then cry because of guilt moments later. I hate what I believe the implant has began to make me feel like. I don’t feel good most days, and I cry often- my confidence has plummeted and I do not feel the same person as I did before the implant or even a few months ago. 

If the implant simply only messed with my period, I would cope, but I am calling my doctor tomorrow."
0.0,"Exacerbated my mental health issues severely with paranoia, anxiety, depression. Heavy bleeding the majority of the time I had it in and became severely anaemic and lost weight. 
I would never recommend this to someone with even the mildest of mental illness."
0.0,"Don't. Even. Bother. Out of all the birth control methods you could use this one is crap. At first it works fine but gradually your body becomes used to the hormones causing you to have month long periods at times. At that point it's like what's the purpose? To keep you from having sex at all? Yeah great method to keep you from having kids (sarcastic). I am so ready to get this thing out, NOT WORTH IT!"
0.0,"When I got this I was all good for a little while I believe I had this for almost a year but since I think for like four months now I've been showing some stuff. Before these four months I get some periods here and there, I had irregular periods and they told me I would bleed more when starting or it could be irregular. But now I've been bleeding or having brown discharge constantly and if it is discharge it's like bleeding cause I've been always needing to wear pads. And I've had some thoughts before but vary rarely but now I get thoughts more which make me panic. Also sometimes I feel numb like no feelings and it upsets me cause I want to feel and that makes me think if I don't  like my boyfriend which I know I do but it always comes up and bothers me. I saw one of the reviews and she had the same exact thing about thoughts and her relationship."
0.0,"I've been on nexplanon for a total of 6 years now (replaced at three year mark) I'm coming up on my due date to have it replaced again in March. I've been noticing a huge elevation in my depression and anxiety. Also started losing weight with no explanation. I've tried everything to try and gain weight, I'll gain 2-3 pounds and immediately lose it in less then 2 days. That started when I got it replaced in 2019. Also noticed an extreme irritability and anger towards such simple things along with my extreme lack of sex drive and emotional connection to those I love and care for. Just very confused and waiting to get this thing removed from my body. Has anyone else had these experiences?"
0.0,"Nexplanon during a pandemic was excessive. I gained 20 lbs without changing anything in my diet or exercise over the 3 year period and the removal process was brutal. The person who implanted the device put it too deep leading to the removal person having to dig it out of tissue. All in all, not worth it. Less painful than an IUD but overall not worth it."
0.0,"Don't do it, I used to eat like a cow and now I can't eat anything and I cant keep anything down. I'm dizzy, tired, sad, or having a panic attack every five minutes and I've only had it for 3 weeks!!!!!! I just wouldn't get it"
0.0,"I had a horrible experience even from the insertion when the nurse punctured me but the implant remained in the device, leading to a second puncture which left a bigger scar. After 6 months of weight gain, fatigue, & bleeding, I asked my doctor to take it out, but she convinced me it just “needed time to adjust.” I let it poison my body for another 6 months. Gained a total of 40 lbs, never stopped bleeding, and developed fatty liver and osteoarthritis even with exercise.When it was removed by a different clinic, the doctor told me it had been imbedded in my muscle. I feel a lot better now that it’s been out for two years. I lost the weight I had gained. (now my body looks different from the stretched skin ). Still dealing with a slight hormone imbalance, complications from fatty liver and osteoporosis. Most upset about how much they pushed it on me & lied when I asked if it would cause weight gain and other health issues.They want $, so do your own research"
0.0,"Absolutely horrendous, have had the implant in for over a year now and I’m finally able to get it removed this week, trying to get the doctors surgery to remove it has been a task, even tho for the past year I’ve had constant bleeding and spotting which is now taking it’s toll I feel drained and tired my moods are all over the place which they have never been, I was put on the pill along side the implant to see if the bleeding would stop which it didn’t it just made me feel worse headaches, spots, bloating. I wouldn’t recommend the implant to anyone it’s been more hassle than it’s worth"
0.0,I used nexplanon for 6 years I first got the implant in 2016 I had it for three years everything was fine I really enjoyed it the first time. I got my second implant in 2019 and also had it for three years the first two years were pretty normal all though I started getting my period the second year every couple months which was nothing to crazy but the third year was a complete disaster I had my period for a whole entire year if I was lucky every 4-5 months I'd get a 3 day break. Having my period everyday made my vagina smell so bad I will never use nexplanon ever again. It was a terrible experience the second time of me using it and definitely wouldn't recommend it to any woman unless you can handle your vagina smelling foul and having your period every single day none stop. The only good thing is you will not get pregnant.
1.0,"I had been on this for 2 years and didn't have a single period. That was nice. And the fact that I didn't get pregnant was nice too. BUT, it caused me to be one very depressed, emotional, anxious and tired all the time. I was not myself and it nearly ruined my relationship. I went off it when we were ready to try for a baby and It's like my brain switched back to normal and I was ME again. 6 weeks after I had my baby I got it back in and I'm not even kidding you when I say the SECOND day of having it in all of those feelings came back. My brain just switched. I'm getting it taken out and have only had it on for a few days. Everybody has different experiences but if you have a hard time with mental health or don't want to experience such a thing I do not recommend."
0.0,"I had Nexplanon for 5 years from the age of (21-25) I was completely fine. I never had any real issues with it. Then it’s time to replace it with a new one. I got my new one replaced In the month of June 2021 and everything was fine. Now just recently it’s February 2nd and I have been getting angry at little things that I shouldn’t even getting angry at. I’ve been feeling sad daily, depressed mood severe, anxiety, intrusive thoughts at work. I’ve never really thought about death and all of a sudden I’ve been thinking about it out of the blue it’s very scary. I stay up late, I don’t sleep regularly. Then when I am up I want to sleep during the day.  I’m debating on whether I’m going to get an appointment to get it removed because I don’t want to live this way with these thoughts, with these horrible feelings. That is NOT okay. I don’t know if they changed the way these are made now but I never experienced this at all with the last implant that I had."
1.0,"I had Nexplanon inserted when I was about 16 and it worked great for the next 2 years. No crazy side effects except acne and a period that was essentially 1 cycle every 2 months (great right?). But this past year being year 3 on Nexplanon, my periods have been extremely irregular. I have had periods that last anywhere from 2 days to over a month long. Not to mention, multiple in a single month sometimes. Prior to Nexplanon, I never had cramps with a regular 5-day period and am currently experiencing terrible cramps on my period. Although it has worked great at preventing pregnancy for me, the irregularity of my periods coming from a normal period (prior to Nexplanon) is a major downside and annoying."
0.0,"The good news-did not get pregnant with nexplanon in. Insertion and removal intimidated me, but were a lot less scary than I thought. I personally did not experience any weight gain or acne either.  The good parts pretty much stop there. 
Now, for the bad and ugly news - I experienced massive sexual dysfunction while using nexplanon. Forget the insanely low libido, the vaginal dryness wreaked havoc down there. Peeing after sex became unbearably painful, to the point I would avoid sex altogether. When my vag wasn’t dry, I was on my period. Sometimes for days, sometimes a month or longer. At the beginning I experienced the dreaded three month period, which my doctor told me was “normal.” For me, it just wasn’t worth the irregular periods and sexual dysfunction. I’m sure some people respond fine to it but LISTEN TO YOUR BODIES! Don’t make the mistake I did of keeping it for a year if it clearly causes issues, your body will thank you."
0.0,"I have always struggled with depression. A few weeks after insertion, my mental health tanked. For the next 4 years I suffered with binge eating and weight gain, severe depression, suicidal thoughts and actions. I tried 10+ antidepressants, anti anxiety, antipsychotics meds, etc. Nothing helped. I began to give up on life. Realized the only thing I hadn't changed, was my birth control. I decided to remove it, 3-4 weeks after removal, I felt like a new person. I felt like the person I hadn't seen in years. Lost 25 lbs in the first few months. Full of energy and motivation. Great for preventing pregnancy, though."
0.0,"All of the other reviews are right. This drug has absolutely abhorrent mental side effects. I've never had mental health problems before but this has caused me to experience depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. Just don't get it."
1.0,"I've been on Nexplanon since November 2020 and I loved it. I did not experience any bleeding or mood changes, which is what I was most worried about. However, almost a year and a half later I am starting to get my period back. As of right now it's coming every two weeks and it's very inconvenient. I'm not sure what to do because I haven't had a problem with it up until now."
0.0,"DO NOT USE THIS BIRTH CONTROL. For years of nexplanon I never had a period and became super depressed with out knowing it, I was moody and had basically ZERO sex drive.
I developed a nasty ovarian cyst which burst and became infected, this took six months to heal.
I started bleeding HEAVILY every day non stop for eight months total. Not to mention the depression and low sex drive NEVER went away.
I couldn't take it any more and had the implant removed.
My doctors kept saying the depression wasn't related to nexplanon but once it was removed I did a complete 180 the first week!
My daily bleeding immediately stopped, my skin even cleared up within a couple days. After a week I actually wanted to have sex again and now I feel SO much happier its unreal.
I'm usually not one to make posts or reviews, but after my experience I truly believe no woman should be on this birth control, it messes up your hormones so much.
Point is, if I could rate this 0/10 I would."
0.0,"My stepmom wanted me to get birth control when I turned 16 just to be safe. I wasn't keen at first, but when I heard it would stop my periods I didn’t mind. Two years later, I have been trying to get this thing taken out for many months. This is terrible. No one said my period would last for 2 months. I went 3 months without a period about 6 months after getting the implant, and that’s all. I have been on my period more than not on this terrible birth control. I loathe it so much. Don’t get this. I am not even sexually active, I would rather literally just never ever having sex or getting my uterus taken out than have to deal with this birth control. I do not recommend this thing to anybody in the entire world unless you really want to be on your period your whole life."
0.0,"I got nexplanon in November of 2020. I had previously been on a few pills all which have made me SUPER depressed and anxious (along with suicidal thoughts). The first year with Nexplanon was no issue. I got my period only a few times and I felt okay. Since then, it has made me gain 40+ pounds in such a short amount of time. I get extremely anxious and emotional/depressed when my period is coming and its affecting my every day life. My intrusive thoughts and anxiety are SO bad now. Also my periods have became SO heavy after the first year on it. Bleeding through tampons at work and waking up in pools of blood. Nexplanon has done a great job at preventing pregnancy, but the physical and emotional side effects are absolutely terrible. I need to find a new BC to go on or to just be done with it all."
0.0,"I got the implant over a year ago when I was 16. I'm now 18 and I am getting the implant out today early because the side effects it has given me are unbearable. At first, I felt completely normal apart from some swelling on my arm however about 6 months in I started to get bad side effects. From then on I have had extremely low mood, anxious thoughts and panic attacks, anger issues, lower sex drive, dark thoughts, uncontrollable crying, back pain and body aching, fatigue, weight gain, my skin got worse and overall I just feel depressed and I feel there is no way out of it. My brain also has got less rational and I feel like there is a fog over my brain, my thoughts seem irrational and I can't manage to balance positive and negative thoughts. I didn't at first put these side effects down to my implant but then when I started reading other peoples reviews, especially people who say they have never felt like this before the implant. Please do not get the implant!!!!!!!"
0.0,"DONT GET IT.
I got this put in almost a year ago (last March). It is January now. About 4 months in I had a panic attack. Never have had a panic attack in my life. Anxiety has never been a problem for me and all the sudden Im avoiding going out with friends cause I feel like I'm going to have a mental break and freak out just talking to my own friends.. Then I started feeling majorly depressed. Haven't felt depressed since pre teen years (10 years ago). November comes around and I'm having suicidal thoughts for weeks while at work. My arm is constantly itching, my periods are all over the place. I can't track them. It's great for preventing pregnancy. But mentally I'm exhausted. I did not fully look into how this affected women until I started feeling this way not understanding why then my boyfriend brought the implant up. I know now. HA. I'm taking this out ASAP."
0.0,I just had mine taken out. I’ve always had anxiety but nothing like what nexplanon will make you feel like. I’ve never had such intense anxiety that I couldn’t leave my house. Yesterday when I went to have it taken out was the first time being in public in three months. It’s not worth the toll it takes on your mental health it was a nightmare I hope I never go through again!!!
1.0,I’ve been on Nexplanon for a year and a half almost two years. I’ve had anxiety most of my life and depression for the past few years before the implant. The implant helped with my depression a good amount but I still feel sad and tired all the time. I honestly feel more tired since I got it. My anxiety has been about the same. I’ve never really been a mood swing person till I started this bc which has been an issue of mine. My period completely stopped after a few weeks of being on bc. Other than that it hasn’t been too bad for me. I don’t feel like myself sometimes which I’ve noticed a lot too. I’ve thought about getting it removed but these are symptoms I can deal with but others may not. It’s not the best bc but it works if you can’t keep up with pills or every 3 month appts to get the depo shot. All I ask is please don’t get the IUD choose any of the other options. The IUD was the worst and everyone I know has had issues with it including infertility.
1.0,"Hi ladies I’m reading most of these and I thought I would share a positive experience with the Mirena! I only got mine Inserted 5 days ago. I’m not going to lie, unless you’ve given birth (which I have not) the insertion will hurt a lot, so prepare for that. I for one didn’t take an Advil or pain medicine beforehand though so I would definitely take some before your appointment. My doctor said there should be some spotting for the next week as well as cramps. Well good news is I spotted for only the first couple days and haven’t since! My skin is clearing up as well! Be prepared for some dizziness after the insertion, even though it only happens to 1 out of 5 people just expect to be a little dizzy. So far I have loved it though! I’m glad I chose the Mirena!"

1.0,"Hello ladies! I’d like to share my happy story!! So, in June 2009 I had the Mirena inserted after my second born. I’ve had a great experience with it. Lighter to no period. At first I bled for a month straight. Then it was lighter, then I started seeing brown discharge, then no periods at all! Well it’s been about 2 1/2 years since I’ve had my replacement. My OB checked it this fall still in the same place and working properly.Before I had Mirena my periods were heavy and bled so much I had to change my clothes. It’s almost been 14 years and I’ll gladly be at my next appointment to get it switched for a new one. Thank you for letting me share!!"
1.0,"I have been on Mirena for almost 2 years. Perfect for birth control. I only experience spotting once in months, no cramps, headache whatsoever. I love it because I don’t see my periods anymore, even the premenstrual moods are gone. My acne also stopped, as I used to get premenstrual acne flare ups. It has really been great for me. 
I am however struggling to loose my baby fat, not sure if it’s got to do with Mirena."
1.0,"I've had a Mirena for almost 4 years now.
Had about 6 weeks of spotting when it was implanted and not a drop of blood since. 
I only “know” I'm on my period when I'm a bit moody or my breasts are painful.
Best decision Ive ever made!! 
My husband and I don't use any other form of birth control and I haven't worried once about getting pregnant 
I had no negative effects from it at all.
Cramping during my “periods” feels a bit different but nothing ibuprofen can't tix 

Won't hesitate to have it replaced next year"
0.0,"6 weeks after I had this coil fitted I collapsed and started with severe pain on the right hand side. I had severe heart burn, no energy and short of breath. I was diagnosed with a cyst in my ovaries. No GP told me it could have been related with the coil. Had the coil removed 4 weeks ago. I have had no pain for 3 days no heartburn and I feel energetic again. I am livid no doctor advised me to take it out. I decided this by myself. The radiologist was the only person that mentioned the related status of the cyst and the coil. Never again"
1.0,"I had the Mirena for six years and loved it! The insertion and day after was pretty rough, severe cramping but I was perfectly fine the day after. I didn't have any noticeable side effects besides my period being lighter, or sometimes not having one at all. I know there's some horror stories but from all the people I know in my personal life everyone loves it including me! Just had mine removed as it was clearly expiring and got the Paragard right after, only reason I switched was because it lasts longer and I wanted to see if there would be a difference from having hormonal birth control, but I would definitely get Mirena again!"
0.0,I had the Mirena IUD for just over a year. And while the purpose was to slow and stop my period because it was so painful and I bled so much the unspoken side effects were life altering in the worst way. None of the medical/drug documents mentioned a risk of depression or suicidal depression yet over the next year I progressed in a fast downward spiral until I was thinking suicidal thoughts. I didn’t realize the connection until recently. I finally got the Mirena out because I was getting so crappy with it in and a few months later my depression eased up and I started to function like a normal person. This drug has unknown and VERY harmful side effects. I would never recommend it to any person for any use. Added 1k monthly cost for mental health treatment caused by this product.

Now February 28 I still have bleeding since inserted, I just went to my GP today, and she did paps smear and other check for possibility infection. Not really happy with the bleeding,  puts  a  downer on my sex life."
1.0,"I got Mirena 2 months ago and for me has been absolutely amazing.
Before, I had nexplanon for about 3 years and I decided to change to Mirena because the depression and anxiety was really hard on  me. All the horrible symptoms that the girls said on Nexplanon reviews I feel like I have it.  Since the insertion of Mirena, I bleed for one month but I think  it’s was due the Nexplanon, because my doctor decided to keep it until make sure Mirena was working to avoid pregnancy.
I went to the doctor to remove Nexplanon and check everything was okay with Mirena. The following day, I immediately stop bleeding.
I’ve just experienced some irregular brown little bleeding and more loss hair than usual.
But everything else is working very well.
I recommend Mirena compared with the pills and Nexplanon."
0.0,"I had an absolutely terrible experience with Mirena. I started having severe anxiety and panic attack, which I had never had before. After a particularly severe panic attack, where I started to disassociate and was sure I was going crazy, I decided to have it taken out. Within a few weeks, my anxiety cleared. I do want to make two caveats:
1) I was only on it for 2 - 3 months, in general it can take up to 6 months for your hormones to stabilise on any new birth control.
2) I have friends with great results on the mirena and little to no side effects - birth control is very personal, so even if it was horrible for me, it might work well for you."
0.0,"I had Mirena inserted for birth control and to help with my heavy, painful periods. Insertion was painful but manageable. I was on my period when it was inserted then continued to bleed for over two weeks. My next 4-5 periods lasted 2 weeks. Then the bleeding went back down to about a week, and I was using less tampons and pads than before insertion, and no insomnia or severe cramping or depression. So I was happy with that aspect of it. 
But I believe Mirena made my sex drive completely disappear. Doctor said to give it time but after 11 months I had it removed 3 days ago. A couple days of spotting then full on heavy bleeding with light cramps and depression. Still no sex drive but praying things improve.
I would be happy with Mirena if I wasn’t sexually active, but it’s not worth it."

1.0,"I got Mirena in 2019, I was 19 years old and this year I will be 22. Before Mirena I had unbearable bleeding and period cramps. The first couple of months with Mirena there was a lot of spotting and took a while for my period to go back to normal. The insertion was probably one of the worst pains of my life! 

However, this will be my 3rd year with Mirena and I like that I can just have it inserted and forget about it. Even though it didn’t completely stop my periods like it said it would, it had definitely made my periods a lot less severe.

Also Mirena has worked great as a birth control! No complaints whatsoever."
0.0,I got mirena placed at my 6 week post partum check (which was actually closer to 7 weeks pp). It didn't hurt too much during insertion which I was surprised. I bled a lot initially. Afterwards I would feel sharp pain in my left side occasionally so I got it checked and the strings were poking my left side vaginal wall. The obgyn didn't recommend cutting the strings any shorter so she just moved them away and that seemed to help but I do still occasionally feel sharp pains. My husband has also been poked by the strings during sex. It's been almost 7 weeks since getting this inserted and I'm still bleeding (not heavy but it's annoying) and I have had what feels like period cramps almost everyday. I have increased acne/oily skin. I also feel anxious and depressed but that could be post partum related. The only positives so far is that it hasn't affect my milk supply & I'm not pregnant. I don't know how much longer I can stand this bleeding and cramping though.

Other than that they weren’t bad to have but the pain is NOT worth getting it put in for them to fall out TWICE!"
1.0,"Hello ladies! I’d like to share my happy story!! So, in June 2009 I had the Mirena inserted after my second born. I’ve had a great experience with it. Lighter to no period. At first I bled for a month straight. Then it was lighter, then I started seeing brown discharge, then no periods at all! Well it’s been about 2 1/2 years since I’ve had my replacement. My OB checked it this fall still in the same place and working properly.Before I had Mirena my periods were heavy and bled so much I had to change my clothes. It’s almost been 14 years and I’ll gladly be at my next appointment to get it switched for a new one. Thank you for letting me share!!"
1.0,"I have been on Mirena for almost 2 years. Perfect for birth control. I only experience spotting once in months, no cramps, headache whatsoever. I love it because I don’t see my periods anymore, even the premenstrual moods are gone. My acne also stopped, as I used to get premenstrual acne flare ups. It has really been great for me. 
I am however struggling to loose my baby fat, not sure if it’s got to do with Mirena."
1.0,"I've had a Mirena for almost 4 years now.
Had about 6 weeks of spotting when it was implanted and not a drop of blood since. 
I only “know” I'm on my period when I'm a bit moody or my breasts are painful.
Best decision Ive ever made!! 
My husband and I don't use any other form of birth control and I haven't worried once about getting pregnant 
I had no negative effects from it at all.
Cramping during my “periods” feels a bit different but nothing ibuprofen can't tix 

Won't hesitate to have it replaced next year"
0.0,"6 weeks after I had this coil fitted I collapsed and started with severe pain on the right hand side. I had severe heart burn, no energy and short of breath. I was diagnosed with a cyst in my ovaries. No GP told me it could have been related with the coil. Had the coil removed 4 weeks ago. I have had no pain for 3 days no heartburn and I feel energetic again. I am livid no doctor advised me to take it out. I decided this by myself. The radiologist was the only person that mentioned the related status of the cyst and the coil. Never again"
1.0,"I had the Mirena for six years and loved it! The insertion and day after was pretty rough, severe cramping but I was perfectly fine the day after. I didn't have any noticeable side effects besides my period being lighter, or sometimes not having one at all. I know there's some horror stories but from all the people I know in my personal life everyone loves it including me! Just had mine removed as it was clearly expiring and got the Paragard right after, only reason I switched was because it lasts longer and I wanted to see if there would be a difference from having hormonal birth control, but I would definitely get Mirena again!"
0.0,I had the Mirena IUD for just over a year. And while the purpose was to slow and stop my period because it was so painful and I bled so much the unspoken side effects were life altering in the worst way. None of the medical/drug documents mentioned a risk of depression or suicidal depression yet over the next year I progressed in a fast downward spiral until I was thinking suicidal thoughts. I didn’t realize the connection until recently. I finally got the Mirena out because I was getting so crappy with it in and a few months later my depression eased up and I started to function like a normal person. This drug has unknown and VERY harmful side effects. I would never recommend it to any person for any use. Added 1k monthly cost for mental health treatment caused by this product.
0.0,"I'm 30 years old, diagnosed with endometrium hyperplasia, I have experience heavy bleeding since 22 years old, sometime 1 month straight bleeding and really really heavy. On November 2021, doctor did biopsy and later on suggest me to try Mirena. On January 25 I got Mirena inserted, that's really painful I almost black out. Now February 28 I still have bleeding since inserted, I just went to my GP today, and she did paps smear and other check for possibility infection. Not really happy with the bleeding,  puts  a  downer on my sex life."
1.0,"I got Mirena 2 months ago and for me has been absolutely amazing.
Before, I had nexplanon for about 3 years and I decided to change to Mirena because the depression and anxiety was really hard on  me. All the horrible symptoms that the girls said on Nexplanon reviews I feel like I have it.  Since the insertion of Mirena, I bleed for one month but I think  it’s was due the Nexplanon, because my doctor decided to keep it until make sure Mirena was working to avoid pregnancy.
I went to the doctor to remove Nexplanon and check everything was okay with Mirena. The following day, I immediately stop bleeding.
I’ve just experienced some irregular brown little bleeding and more loss hair than usual.
But everything else is working very well.
I recommend Mirena compared with the pills and Nexplanon."
0.0,"I had an absolutely terrible experience with Mirena. I started having severe anxiety and panic attack, which I had never had before. After a particularly severe panic attack, where I started to disassociate and was sure I was going crazy, I decided to have it taken out. Within a few weeks, my anxiety cleared. I do want to make two caveats:
1) I was only on it for 2 - 3 months, in general it can take up to 6 months for your hormones to stabilise on any new birth control.
2) I have friends with great results on the mirena and little to no side effects - birth control is very personal, so even if it was horrible for me, it might work well for you."
0.0,"I had Mirena inserted for birth control and to help with my heavy, painful periods. Insertion was painful but manageable. I was on my period when it was inserted then continued to bleed for over two weeks. My next 4-5 periods lasted 2 weeks. Then the bleeding went back down to about a week, and I was using less tampons and pads than before insertion, and no insomnia or severe cramping or depression. So I was happy with that aspect of it. 
But I believe Mirena made my sex drive completely disappear. Doctor said to give it time but after 11 months I had it removed 3 days ago. A couple days of spotting then full on heavy bleeding with light cramps and depression. Still no sex drive but praying things improve.
I would be happy with Mirena if I wasn’t sexually active, but it’s not worth it."
0.0,"The first year I bleed a lot then it settled and I had a period every month after a year or so. At this point I became happy with it.
By the 2nd year 4 weeks prior to my wedding, I had all the pregnancy symptoms… then the test confirmed it.
I was devastated. Would never have a coil again."
0.0,"After having bariatric surgery Sept 2018, I began having abnormally heavy bleeding. Keep in mind at 42 - I had mostly experienced amenorrhea due to my obesity.
My OBGYN suggested MIRENA to help. 
Inserted April 2019.
I still have a 5 day regular period every single month. Sometimes twice a month. I experience painfully dry intercourse, And often random spotting. 
When it's time to remove, I will NOT replace."
1.0,"I haven’t stopped having a period, acne and constant headaches.
Never had acne before this.
I haven’t gained weight, lost 4 lb which is because I'm always on the loo .
Water retention weight loss.
Feeling not the same.
It was fitted the end of November 2021 the Mirena Coil.
Breast feel so sore. 
The fitting was easy, I took painkillers as prescribed before.
I am giving it until April if staying or taking out.
I hear such positive results and I thought that was going to be me, sadly it wasn’t.
But it might settle still. Fingers crossed.
Good luck all."
0.0,"4 weeks after I had the coil fitted I had severe abdominal pain and collapsed. I also started having headaches, migraines, terrible heartburn. After some scans I found out I had a cyst in my ovaries possibly caused by the coil. I am having it removed by my own suggestion as no Doctor mentioned to me this could be related."
0.0,"I would not recommend this product at all. I got it put in on the 14th December 2021 and had it removed before the end of January 2022. The cramps and bleeding were unbearable. In fact I am still bleeding now. This was supposed to make my life simpler, but in fact it has made me feel so ill. My experience has been so bad that I hope to discourage anyone else having one fitted."
0.0,"I had Mirena implanted on 12/2/21 and had a lot of complications following it, from severe pain, bleeding, to a strong odor starting two weeks post implant.  6 wks post implant I started to run a fever around 100F.  In addition to fever, severe facial pressure incl on the eyes causing red eyes and difficulty focusing, pain to the touch on the skull, severe headaches, and stiff neck.  1/25/22 I had blood work done, coming back with highly elevated liver levels, ALT, AST, protein, and calcium.  Elevated RBC, hemoglobin, and sedimentation rates.  I was tested for everything imaginable, all negative, including BV.  2/7/2022 I had Mirena removed, one week post removal and my levels are starting to return to normal.  Fever is still present, day 34 today.  Doctors are hesitant to entertain this is related, however, it seems rather relevant."
0.0,"So I had Mirena 3 months post partum,  I didn't feel much of anything during insertion. I bled for 3 months (spotting and sometimes heavy bleeding ) sex drive came to a zero and my worst of all issue is weight gain. I  tried all my weight loss routine to no avail. My abdomen just became rounder .  I am getting it removed tomorrow I have it in for a total of 4 months and I can't wait to get it out . I would get a non hormonal IUD instead ."
1.0,"I got Mirena in 2019, I was 19 years old and this year I will be 22. Before Mirena I had unbearable bleeding and period cramps. The first couple of months with Mirena there was a lot of spotting and took a while for my period to go back to normal. The insertion was probably one of the worst pains of my life! 

However, this will be my 3rd year with Mirena and I like that I can just have it inserted and forget about it. Even though it didn’t completely stop my periods like it said it would, it had definitely made my periods a lot less severe.

Also Mirena has worked great as a birth control! No complaints whatsoever."
0.0,I got mirena placed at my 6 week post partum check (which was actually closer to 7 weeks pp). It didn't hurt too much during insertion which I was surprised. I bled a lot initially. Afterwards I would feel sharp pain in my left side occasionally so I got it checked and the strings were poking my left side vaginal wall. The obgyn didn't recommend cutting the strings any shorter so she just moved them away and that seemed to help but I do still occasionally feel sharp pains. My husband has also been poked by the strings during sex. It's been almost 7 weeks since getting this inserted and I'm still bleeding (not heavy but it's annoying) and I have had what feels like period cramps almost everyday. I have increased acne/oily skin. I also feel anxious and depressed but that could be post partum related. The only positives so far is that it hasn't affect my milk supply & I'm not pregnant. I don't know how much longer I can stand this bleeding and cramping though.
0.0,"Horrible. I've had the Mirena IUD for 7 months and it's given me horribly greasy skin and hair, acne all over my face, neck, chest, and back, an alarming amount of my hair fell out in the first 3 months and is growing back thinner, I have dull pain the right right side of my abdomen, and I'm still having regular periods PLUS additional spotting 7-10 days per month. My OBGYN said to give it 6 months to ""even out,"" and the side effects are only getting words, so I'm having it removed ASAP. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1.0,"I've had the Mirena for going on 5 years now, I've had zero complications, no mood swings, or weight gain. My sex drive remained the same as before I got it. It's so nice to not have to worry about periods! I'm due to get it removed in May."
0.0,"I'm starting to wonder if my ""doc"" hadn't done something right. I have been cramping miserably everyday since. this was supposed to eliminate the pain and bleeding;as if it's only made things that much more difficult.  this sucks!!  Besides the constant abnormal bleeding, I can uncomfortably feel this stupid thing - all the time. I want it gone. I would prefer an ablation at this point. I have no use for my dang uterus anyway."
1.0,"At first I thought it's a nightmare. The insertion was extremely painful and so were first two weeks. I had sick leave in my job as I wasn't able to work due to this pain.
When the pain started to be acceptable  had spottings/bleeding for a whole month. I wasn't happy but it was ok. After 3 months it started to be much better. I almost have no periods now, the uterus hurts few times a month (and the pain is smaller than my periods before Mirena).
And the most important - no babies so far.
I'm giving 8/10 because at the beginning was really harsh. And the pain was unacceptable. But now I'M so happy 
I have Mirena!"
0.0,"I had my Mirena inserted 2 months ago. There has been no reprieve from the heavy and prolonged period  , which was the reason for the insertion.  There is also constant pinching pain on my left like my ovaries are being jabbed. The Gyneacologist did two Telehealth consult charging me $200 each time and has done nothing except telling me its probably because I had a curettage at the same time. Not happy and wish there was a more realistic disclosure about what to expect."

0.0,"I’m 41, had it inserted to regulate hormones, heavy periods and possible endometriosis, (one child). Insertion was painful but bearable and quick, not as bad as anticipated. After insertion I had cramping and pinching sharpe pains for 7 days, continuous light bleed and odd mucus/ discharge. Began to bleed heavily on day 9 (4 days before due period). Heavy bleeding and clotting was relentless, (I’m used to heavy periods, this was a huge amount of clotting), felt depressed and exhausted. The most excruciating camps, on a level with labour pains day 16, lasted intensely for 45 min  and left me numb with pain and unable work. I found it impossible to concentrate and developed tinnitus. Heavy bleed continued for 12 days. Episode of confused dizziness and nausea, sent to hospital, dr suggested a ‘big shot’ of progesterone and drugs to stop the bleeding but exhausted I decided to have it removed 3 weeks after insertion. Removal was easy, bleeding eased immediately."
0.0,"My periods are obviously not as often but when I do get them, the spotting can take up to 2 months non-stop. It's like having a light period but for an extended time. Cramps are pretty bad I never had to take Mydol before and now I have to."
0.0,"The biggest mistake I’ve ever made. I had mine in for about 6 months for endometriosis. I went on it to better regulated my periods after experiencing spotting with Ashlyna and my cramps. It didn’t help with my cramps. I gained 20 lbs in 6 months with ZERO life style changes. I worked out, I ate less, etc. I swelled up. Online it says hormonal IUD weight gain is uncommon/unlikely, but tell that to me and the hundreds of other women who have gained excessive weight after insertion. I got mine out a week ago and I’ve already lost 5lbs with no lifestyle change. I had to go off it as the weight gain began affecting my self esteem and I couldn’t fit into my jeans anymore. I do like the security it provided in terms of birth control, though. I would get a copper IUD for that except the procedure is so damn painful they thought they perforated my uterus and I had to go to the ER. I don’t recommend this in terms of.. well anything really. It did help my period become more regular, though."
0.0,I got the depo shot as my only choice through local health department as I had no insurance at the time I  was on day 3 of a period when given. It stopped my period after a few days then on the 24 th started that very light brown bleeding and it hasn't stopped I'm going on week 3 and I call them and they say that this is normal. This is not normal and I want it stopped. Any recommendations of over the counter stuff to stop the bleeding as I am so over this.

1.0,"I have been taking Depo-Provera for well over 10 years. With no bleeding or periods just spotting every once in a while. I’m currently about 3 weeks away from my next shot. I’ve been going crazy because I have been spotting and slightly bleeding for the last 2 weeks.  I thought something was wrong. Like I missed my last shot or I skipped the one due but I’m right on schedule. I am glad I found these posts, because I feel  they have definitely reformulated the shot and I don’t feel alone in this. I’m sure it is due to ingredient restraints but I would have rather been informed than surprised."
1.0,"I recently just stopped getting my depo Provera injections this past month. The only reason I have stopped is because I have been advised by my doctor that it is not a good long-term form of birth control due to the fact that it causes a loss in calcium in your bones. I was on the shot for a little over 2 years, and I had little to no side effects. I had almost no period at all the entire time I was on it, besides some spotting a couple days every couple months (which only lasted a couple days) ...I never experienced sudden heavy bleeding like others have mentioned, so I am not sure if there was a change in the injection formula but only some woman's bodies responded to it. Aside from my period, I did have a low sex drive. Overall, I had no extremely negative side effects. None that beat how good it was at preventing pregnancy at least. I had unprotected sex the whole time I was on it! That's a win in my opinion."
0.0,My last baby was born 22/2/21 and between then and now 7/3/22 I haven’t stopped bleeding. I’m due my 4th shot today and if this one doesn’t change things rapidly then it will be my last. The pain is the worst and bleeding to the point it runs down my legs
0.0,"My cycle has always been predictable, every 28 days, with 4 days of bleeding, 1-1.5 days I’d consider moderate-heavy. I started Depo late Nov 2021 and bled for 4 weeks straight, light to moderate bleeding. I just had my second injection in Feb 2022, and I’m on my 4th week of bleeding, but this time it’s heavy and I pass a lot of clots, which is definitely not normal for me. I’m not planning on continuing with this birth control because bleeding this long is not normal and can lead to iron anemia. Women should report these abnormal symptoms to their Dr’s."
1.0,"I've been on Depo-Provera for 7 years and haven't had a period in the last 3 years. However, since 2/14/22, I've been on my period for 19 days straight. I freaked out on the 14th day, messaged my OBGYN and she put me on 1 mg Estradiol (Estrogen) tablets to help ""fluff up"" my uterine lining. She explained, ""Depoprovera thins the lining of the uterus (endometrium) which is why most women don't have periods while on it. Thin lining isn't dangerous. But sometimes if the lining is really thin, then the underlying muscle wall of the uterus bleeds irregularly. So by increasing the estrogen, we can fluff up the lining of the uterus (coat the muscle wall of the uterus) and stop the vaginal bleeding.""
 
Bleeding is now very light and hoping it stops tomorrow, as it will be my last pill. If the bleeding continues, I was told to go in for a gyn exam and/or order a pelvic ultrasound to look at my uterus. She also said,  ""Weight change and stress can effect your period."""
0.0,"I was on depo for 3 years. It will definitely prevent pregnancy because you will have no desire for sex in the first place. Also, I bled for months straight constantly.  As soon as I got off my sex drive came back, not as strong as it was before but it’s back. It was only a plus because it was every 3 months."

If only I would have known!!!! Not taking it again."
0.0,"It's great in that it's low maintenance, and for me I only had the regular side effects for about the first two weeks. But a constant my whole time on depo has been daily bleeding, and since getting the last shot it's been worse to the point where TMI I know but I now get clots. That's been the one con especially as it means I bleed during sex (I'm lucky in that my boyfriend is totally okay with it though and not grossed out at all). Judging by other people's experiences on here, especially those who have been on it for several years, I'd guess they've changed something in the shot itself and now we're all suffering the effects of that"
0.0,"Update on my comment below. Depo didn't work for me. I experienced VERY HEAVY BLEEDING with clots. Our bodies are all different and the medication /dosage required is different. 
I have now switched to EVRA birth control patch & it is working perfectly for me. I no longer require tranexamic acid. Just glad and grateful to God for these inventions, and that I was able to locate something that works for me. 

I have read several reports on faliures and complications of Endometrial ablation and Hysterectomy. I would advise ladies to do their research & be very cautious with such risky proceedures even if Doctors suggest it.
It's difficult to be patient when you feel like you're under pressure or even bleeding and Anemic. I suggest prayer, calmness & research. Don't rush into procedure or surgery. 
Removing your uterus or other parts from your body can cause further complications - this has happened to several people. And once you go that route you can't undo your action. Cheers!"

0.0,"We are done having kids. Over 9 years, I have tried several different IUDs and pills, but results were unsatisfactory overall. I came off the pill and took the Depo Provera shot one week ago. My primary goal was to reduce period bleeding and I was prepared to wait through spotting. However, Depo didn't work for me. I experienced VERY HEAVY BLEEDING with clots. I was prescribed tranexamic acid which has reduced the bleeding on day 1. I plan to take 2 pills daily for 8 days , and hopefully the bleeding will stop. Otherwise, I'll keep using tranex to manage symptoms till my 3 months on Depo expire.

I will not be taking another Depo  shot. I'm happy to manage my periods with tranexamic acid alone. I didn't try tranex acid while on the pill as I was advised of risk of increased clots. I'm so grateful to God for the invention of tranexamic acid and expect to live my life freely from here on now using it. I also considered ablation or a hysterectomy but decided neither was worth the risk!"

I am glad I found these posts, because I feel  they have definitely reformulated the shot and I don’t feel alone in this. I’m sure it is due to ingredient restraints but I would have rather been informed than surprised."
1.0,"I recently just stopped getting my depo Provera injections this past month. The only reason I have stopped is because I have been advised by my doctor that it is not a good long-term form of birth control due to the fact that it causes a loss in calcium in your bones. I was on the shot for a little over 2 years, and I had little to no side effects. I had almost no period at all the entire time I was on it, besides some spotting a couple days every couple months (which only lasted a couple days) ...I never experienced sudden heavy bleeding like others have mentioned, so I am not sure if there was a change in the injection formula but only some woman's bodies responded to it. Aside from my period, I did have a low sex drive. Overall, I had no extremely negative side effects. None that beat how good it was at preventing pregnancy at least. I had unprotected sex the whole time I was on it! That's a win in my opinion."
0.0,My last baby was born 22/2/21 and between then and now 7/3/22 I haven’t stopped bleeding. I’m due my 4th shot today and if this one doesn’t change things rapidly then it will be my last. The pain is the worst and bleeding to the point it runs down my legs
0.0,"My cycle has always been predictable, every 28 days, with 4 days of bleeding, 1-1.5 days I’d consider moderate-heavy. I started Depo late Nov 2021 and bled for 4 weeks straight, light to moderate bleeding. I just had my second injection in Feb 2022, and I’m on my 4th week of bleeding, but this time it’s heavy and I pass a lot of clots, which is definitely not normal for me. I’m not planning on continuing with this birth control because bleeding this long is not normal and can lead to iron anemia. Women should report these abnormal symptoms to their Dr’s."
1.0,"I've been on Depo-Provera for 7 years and haven't had a period in the last 3 years. However, since 2/14/22, I've been on my period for 19 days straight. I freaked out on the 14th day, messaged my OBGYN and she put me on 1 mg Estradiol (Estrogen) tablets to help ""fluff up"" my uterine lining. She explained, ""Depoprovera thins the lining of the uterus (endometrium) which is why most women don't have periods while on it. Thin lining isn't dangerous. But sometimes if the lining is really thin, then the underlying muscle wall of the uterus bleeds irregularly. So by increasing the estrogen, we can fluff up the lining of the uterus (coat the muscle wall of the uterus) and stop the vaginal bleeding.""
 
Bleeding is now very light and hoping it stops tomorrow, as it will be my last pill. If the bleeding continues, I was told to go in for a gyn exam and/or order a pelvic ultrasound to look at my uterus. She also said,  ""Weight change and stress can effect your period."""
0.0,"I was on depo for 3 years. It will definitely prevent pregnancy because you will have no desire for sex in the first place. Also, I bled for months straight constantly.  As soon as I got off my sex drive came back, not as strong as it was before but it’s back. It was only a plus because it was every 3 months."
0.0,"I received the depo shot on December 8 and as of December 22, having heavy (not spotting!!!!!!!) bleeding and really bad cramps. Taking ibuprofen like crazy. Wiped the floor at least 3 times because the bleeding wouldn't stop. For me it did not work at all. I regret having the injection. Made my usual (but pretty bad) menstrual problems so much worse!!!! If only I would have known!!!! Not taking it again."
0.0,"It's great in that it's low maintenance, and for me I only had the regular side effects for about the first two weeks. But a constant my whole time on depo has been daily bleeding, and since getting the last shot it's been worse to the point where TMI I know but I now get clots. That's been the one con especially as it means I bleed during sex (I'm lucky in that my boyfriend is totally okay with it though and not grossed out at all). Judging by other people's experiences on here, especially those who have been on it for several years, I'd guess they've changed something in the shot itself and now we're all suffering the effects of that"
0.0,"Update on my comment below. Depo didn't work for me. I experienced VERY HEAVY BLEEDING with clots. Our bodies are all different and the medication /dosage required is different. 
I have now switched to EVRA birth control patch & it is working perfectly for me. I no longer require tranexamic acid. Just glad and grateful to God for these inventions, and that I was able to locate something that works for me. 

I have read several reports on faliures and complications of Endometrial ablation and Hysterectomy. I would advise ladies to do their research & be very cautious with such risky proceedures even if Doctors suggest it.
It's difficult to be patient when you feel like you're under pressure or even bleeding and Anemic. I suggest prayer, calmness & research. Don't rush into procedure or surgery. 
Removing your uterus or other parts from your body can cause further complications - this has happened to several people. And once you go that route you can't undo your action. Cheers!"
0.0,This is awful. Has wrecked my hormones. Wanted to like it but I’ve been on my period off and on for the 4 months I’ve been on it.
1.0,"It has helped me a lot in terms of pain relief I have little to no pain since starting depo. However I am on a high dose. I take 300mg every 6 weeks because when I was on 150mg every month I still felt pain. Only side effect I have experienced is weight gain, I gained about 30 lbs since I started it in late 2020. I have also noticed that my pH becomes imbalanced way more easily since I've been on it but other than that I'm grateful for the relief."
0.0,"We are done having kids. Over 9 years, I have tried several different IUDs and pills, but results were unsatisfactory overall. I came off the pill and took the Depo Provera shot one week ago. My primary goal was to reduce period bleeding and I was prepared to wait through spotting. However, Depo didn't work for me. I experienced VERY HEAVY BLEEDING with clots. I was prescribed tranexamic acid which has reduced the bleeding on day 1. I plan to take 2 pills daily for 8 days , and hopefully the bleeding will stop. Otherwise, I'll keep using tranex to manage symptoms till my 3 months on Depo expire.

I will not be taking another Depo  shot. I'm happy to manage my periods with tranexamic acid alone. I didn't try tranex acid while on the pill as I was advised of risk of increased clots. I'm so grateful to God for the invention of tranexamic acid and expect to live my life freely from here on now using it. I also considered ablation or a hysterectomy but decided neither was worth the risk!"
0.0,"My experience on the depo-provera injection was truly a nightmare. It made me moody and cry everyday. Sex became unbearably painful, no matter how much lube we used. One of the worst parts of it was that it made my hair fall out! I’ve been off of it for over 6 months and am still waiting for my hair to grow back, and I hope it does. Never again! This stuff ruined my life!"
0.0,"It’s been 85 days and I’m still bleeding… got the injections to regulate my heavy periods due to low iron, but having to bleed everyday instead is even worse. I’ll take back those heavy 4 days a month any day"
0.0,"It worked- I never did get pregnant while using this birth control, however, I would go two months without a period, the get a period for a month while actively using it. After I got my tubes tied, I stopped taking it, and my periods were semi normal. Cramping was worse, starting two weeks prior to every period, and akin to labor, accompanied by a whopping 20 lbs of water weight during my period. My cycles were 38 days at the time. I was actively trying to lose weight, ate healthy, got exercise, didn't shed a pound, and instead gained. My thyroid hormones were way off. A year out, I'm finally back to my normal cycle length, shedding pounds like I'm trying to, bloating a typical amount for me (half, at 10lbs), cramping and mood swings have reduced, and all of my hormones are finally back to normal with no medication, change of lifestyle, or any treatment whatsoever. You might not get pregnant, but it'll be at a cost. No, I have not changed anything else in my life."
0.0,Same as everyone else if I had to know more about it wouldn't have got the shot.
1.0,I’ve been on depo 29 years and haven’t had any bleeding until 14 days ago and now it won’t stop. Very glad to see I’m not the only one!
1.0,I've been on this shot now for 13 years haven't missed an injection and always get it on day 1 or 2 in my window. I occasionally would get break through bleeding a day or two before my next shot. Nothing serious just inconvenient to light for a tampon too much for a liner type thing. My last shot was in December my window doesn't open for a few weeks and I have had the heaviest period of my life. I started the shot because I got large cysts on my ovaries that were super painful. I hadn't had issues with them or a period in the time I've been on it. Until this time. I don't know what's going on but I hope this isn't the new normal.
0.0,"I’ve been on the depo shot for a year. This January I was supposed to get another injection but I switched to the pill. The whole year I experienced bleeding every day…. EVERY day. Less than a normal period but more than spotting. I asked doctors multiple times if this was normal and they told me yes every time, nothing to worry about. I also realized my hair was falling out, didn’t alarm me at first because I have thick and long hair. I realized my hair was falling out and not growing back! Yay birth control. These are “very rare” side effects but it happened to me. My skin looks good, didn’t gain weight."
0.0,"I had Depo-Provera for 3 years and took a break restarting in November 2021 big mistake. First 9 weeks fine then started with the brown spotting developing into full blown period that I've had for 5 weeks now. Even had next injection early to try and help nothing helping so far. I'm in agreement somethings changed had zero problems last time. Now no sex, anaemic and grumpy. Definitely not having this again!"
0.0,"So, after I gave birth to my fifth child at age 42, at my postpartum appointment my ob/gyn sold it to me as though I was going spot any way while nursing. I'm angry he didn't tell me I can bleed for 3 months or longer on this injection. Within days I became enraged, I didn't like may newborn at all and could care a less about it (which I have never ever felt until after the shot. I also never felt that way with any of my babies). Not only did I feel enraged, but started spotting within days, lost my sex drive, then went into light bleeding the 2nd week, then 3rd week getting blood clots, now going into my 4th week with huge blood clots. I'm taking iron now. I also have headaches every day. When I looked up reviews with this depo shot, I was crying almost every day and beating myself up for taking this shot. This stupid drug has jacked up my sex life with my husband and I obviously have no desire to have sex on my period with all these blood clots coming out. I will never again take this shot nor recommend it."
0.0,"Although my Depo experience was in 2008, I thought I would chime in.  I did not want to go on depo provera, I had been suffering with endometriosis for years and I had major concerns as I also suffer from multiple mood issues. I finally relented and booked a desperate appointment. I was to have 6 injections. When the nurse injected my first dose, her exact words were “you’re going to go crazy for the first few weeks.” WOW, great to know now that you’ve just injected me. Exactly 2 weeks after my injection without thinking I had a suicide attempt. I had also written a suicide note which I have no memory of. I’m not sure how, but I woke up the next day. Although very sick, I faked health to family and friends but could not get out bed. I was rushed to emerg a day later where the doctors where shocked I was alive. Took a year to recover."
0.0,I had my last injection of depo 2 months ago and haven’t stopped bleeding. Constant period for 2 months. I can definitely say I will not be getting it again!!
1.0,For everyone reading this who is scared that they are pregnant there is hope!! My boyfriend and I were drunk and had unprotected sex. It wasn’t until after that I realized I was ovulating and in my fertile week (according to Flo). I took the pill 6 hours after when the store was open and felt awful. I had cramps on and off for a week and was so tired. Around day 6 after taking the pill I started spotting. I was sure it was implantation bleeding until it got heavier the next few days. My period came two days early! It messes with your body but it does what it’s supposed to do!
1.0,"Plan B served it's purpose and worked for me when I had sex with no protection during my fertile window. However, the lack of information regarding the side effects it's really concerning. In many credible websites it is stated that the side effects last at maximum one week. Well, that certainly wasn't the case for me, and as I can assume by reading the reviews here, not the case for many people. After the first few days of taking the pill I experienced no side effects. Only after 4/5 days of taking it i started experienced spotting, similar to my similar period, but that only lasted for about 3 days. After that I experienced severe headaches, nausea, really drastic mood swings for the rest of the month. It's an incredible high dosage of hormones and it can mess up with you body and make you go through a pretty tough time for way longer than one week. I got my period exactly one week late of when I expected, so I can't really complain in that regard because it does work."
1.0,"For anyone worrying and stressing, you’ll be fine. This is my second time taking Plan B and the first time is always rough. Put trust in the pill. The first time I was anxious, stressed, and googling every pregnancy symptom because I’m 18 and can’t have a kid yet. I took the pill Jan 26 and got my period a day later than usual (Feb 16). I had to take it again on March 23rd because semen had gotten on me but not in me so my boyfriend and I rushed to the nearest CVS and I took the pill and I got my period five days later (March 28)!!! I'm two weeks early for my usual period date but I’m sure that’s the effects of the pill! distract yourself and trust that it worked (definitely works better the sooner you take it)."
1.0,"So I took plan B about 12 hours after having unprotected sex. I was ovulating and he wasn’t sure if he came or not. These reviews helped me stay at ease, so I decided to come and tell you my feedback. It works and my period came a day early. Don’t stress! It’s $50 for a reason. My period is pretty brutal, but it is better than an unwanted pregnancy. Stay safe ladies and relax"
1.0,"So I told myself I wouldn't say jack until the stuff worked lol. I was scared, I saw reviews that should calm me but I was still scared. Probably because mine was quite different. March 4th and 5th I had unprotected sex with my Boyfriend at least 5 times. He did not cum inside me, but we never can tell. I used post pill on the 5th. That was when it hit me few hours later that I was ovulating, NO!! I started searching online and I saw where ""pills don't work during ovulation"". Everything went blank lmao. I'd say don't even try researching and buying lots of PT tests, but some of us can't help it even though the truth is right on our faces lol. So for the benefit of doubts. You can try. But I wouldn't advice it, it's waste of money. The pills work 100%. I saw some spotting 2 days after I used the pill. Some people here said 5 days mostly. Mine was Day 2. Everything was happening to me, nausea, bloating, hardened nipples and I was so miserable lol. Got my period March 21. So Relax Girl! Kisses"
1.0,"GIRLLLLL LEMME TELL YOU!! 
Plan B works!  I know you will afraid because I was. But trust me it works, I have a long distance relationship with my boyfriend and he came to visit me and the condom broke and we were both terrified because I’m 19 and he’s 20 and we’re in a long-distance relationship, we weren’t ready to have a kid, so we got plan B delivered, I took not even after 30 min, then I checked my period app and it said that I was on my last day of ovulation, I don’t know what else to do so I went to my best friend and she told me “ I read somewhere that Plan B doesn’t work on your ovulation“ so after hearing that I started to freak out. I went to Google to see if it was true, I know worst decision in my life, I saw all these things about how plan b doesn’t work on your ovulation so I started crying but then I found this website, and saw there are plenty of girls in the same boat as me. I bled and now I finally got my period! Trust the pill!!"
1.0,"Well I did the deed around 2:30 AM & He finished  in me. I checked my period tracker & since I had just finished my period 6 days prior I was on either day 2/3 or being fertile, meaning I was preparing to ovulate. I was freaking out because this was my first time this happened. Around 3:30 pm I took the Plan B pill so within 12/13 hours. The next week I was feeling nauseated, EXTREMELY bloated, had weird discharge. 4 days after my expected ovulation date, I was spotting pink & light brown & I swore it was implantation bleeding. At that point I was fully convinced I was pregnant. I took a few pregnancy test ( 12 days ) after I had unprotected sex  & it came up negative but that wasn't enough for me considering my body literally felt like it was early pregnancy symptoms. On my expected period day my back was giving me the worst pain off my life & the my period magically came. Don't google anything just believe in the pill!!"
1.0,"Hello, so I took Plan B the morning after having unprotected intercourse (obv) but the point is that my ovulation was due 2 days after unprotected sex. I started spotted 3 days after I took the pill and assumed it was a side effect or failed ovulation (idk what it was exactly). My period was late 6 days so I was definitely getting concerned and worried I was expecting. My period had finally came! I also used some manifesting or what not but in the end everything worked out to my favor. I wanna let y’all know everything is gonna be okay… seriously. The thought and process of even thinking you could possibly be a mother soon is very scary especially when you’re unprepared and very young like myself. I also promised myself I would come back and share some of the experience so that other young girls know they’re not alone. However, plz be safe and take care of yourselves… And remember to breathe and try to not stress!"
1.0,"hey guys I’m 22 years old I’m bf is 20 we had sex and we haven’t had sex in so long and it just felt amazing I had him cum inside me I know what y’all are thinking… like what I know RIGHT! And I’m not even on birth control plus he did it the day of my ovulation, which was worse so I took plan B ASAP. Lady’s let me tell you it was awful I was bloated I felt sick I felt like crap!!! and my mood swings was off the chainnn it felt like I was pregnant!!! But it’s crazy how you mind makes you think that. My period did some a few days late. The plan b does work please don’t listen to those google post about it doesn’t work if you take it during your ovulation. I took it my period still came just trust the pill! DO NOT PANIC and please  don’t be like me please have protected sex no matter how amazing it feels…"
1.0,"So my boyfriend and I had sex on February 14th with no protection and he pulled out and came after few seconds. I am a paranoid person so I began to stress out when I saw that I was in my fertile window (2 days before ovulation) and went to google immediately. That was my biggest mistake, don't do that!! It said that I can get pregnant even with precum. After 2 hours I made my boyfriend go and buy me a Plan B. Next two weeks were horrible because I was stressing myself out from reading all the pregnancy symptoms. 3 or 4 days before my period arrived, I've started to be nauseous and couldn't eat breakfast because I felt like I would throw up. My stomach was bloated all the time and it was very gassy. I even tried to check my cervix and it was high (it supposed to mean that I've conceived). I was about to buy myself pregnancy test this morning but I finally got my period (March 5th). Please don't worry and don't google your symptoms because they're all the same! This pill works 100%."
1.0,"DO NOT WORRY!!!! I WAS SO SCARED THIS WAS NOT GOING TO WORK BECAUSE THE CONDOM BROKE THE DAY BEFORE MY OVULATION DAY!! I track my period through the Flo app and given that the condom ripped and he ejaculated when it was a day before my set ovulation day, my boyfriend and I were both scared it wouldn’t work (being 18 I’m nowhere ready to have a kid). I took the Plan B about 2 hours after the incident. I felt no symptoms when I took it but about a week later I noticed I was a little bloated, was more emotional, fatigue, and I was EXTREMELY nauseated. I know people say these symptoms only happen 24h after u take the pill but that’s NOT true. Read almost all the other experiences with this pill and it’s true it DOES work and YOU will be OKAY!! It costs 50 dollars for a reason and don’t stress yourself out about it because  that can cause even more delay in your period besides the pill itself! YOU’LL BE ALRIGHT!❤️"
1.0,"Ladies, yes Plan B is a bit expensive, but it's absolutely worth it. If that's what you're thinking about just go pay it, it's worth the cost. Abortion is far more expensive and far worse of an experience. And having a baby of course is even more expensive. But more than anything your regret and anxiety is even worse! You will thank yourself later that you took it. I was skeptical if I got pregnant from that one time but all it takes is one time, so my logic finally kicked in and I ran to go get it. I had sex on Friday and didn't go until Monday morning to get Plan B and still got my period about 14 days later. It worked. I got it at my local Ralph's and you have to ask a store clerk to open their glass display case where it's locked up to give it to you. Just try to do nice meditations and breathing exercises and relax and trust that this pill does what it's supposed to. There are so many reviews here as proof. Also I don't know about the cheaper generic brands but I now love Plan B!"
1.0,"I'm going to be as detailed as possible because if you're someone like me you need every detail when you're stressing. First I want to ease your mind about side effects and tell you that despite all my fears, I had zero side effects. None. I braced for the worst and didn't have any side effects whatsoever. And my period started exactly on time. I had my normal PMS symptoms, nothing out of the ordinary. And my period has been normal, not heavy or anything like I feared. Here is my story: I had unprotected sex on February 11 (he ejaculated in me twice). My period was on February 1 so I had sex in my absolute most fertile time and took Plan B during ovulation. Online tells you it won't work during ovulation. Take it anyway, it still works! I'm proof. Never took Plan B before and was so scared and frozen and didn't know what to do that I didn't take Plan B until the 3rd day at 55th hour. I'm so glad I did. I had less anxiety about pregnancy waiting the last 2 weeks. GO GET IT NOW!!"
1.0,"UPDATE I made a review this morning and my period finally came!!! 13 days late, day 37 since my last period and now I’m finally starting to bleed. Going to take a pregnancy test probably tomorrow to confirm. But ladies, this pill works. My system was totally messed up and I’m nowhere NEAR wanting kids. My body took me through hell to get here, but it works."
1.0,"Like a lot of people on here I was so scared that plan b wouldn’t work, I had sex 6th Feb one day before I ovulated even though he pulled out I was so scared because of pre-cum. I took the pill 29 hours later, I was nauseous and had ovary pain and a bit of discharge and sore breasts. I got my period today 23rd Feb, I usually have 30 day cycles so I was 2 days late but had period cramps a few days before so I knew it was coming, vitamin c, yoga, and camomile, ginger tea, exercise induces your period quicker so try doing that!  Stay calm as stress will just make it later, it will work for you this site helps a lot and DO NOT LOOK UP SYMPTOMS!! Good luck ladies♥️"
1.0,"Before I get into my experience, GIRL YOU WILL BE FINE! I have used the plan b 3 times in one week and I promised myself that I would come back here to share my experience if it worked. I have a boyfriend and he came to visit me for two weeks we used condoms every time we had sex but for some reason they kept on breaking. Let’s  say this happened 3 times in 2 weeks and every time I took a plan b within the 48 hours. I googled like crazy what could happen and I came across many websites saying that a plan b would fail during ovulation. I started panicking cause those were the weeks of my suspected ovulation. As well as the side effects of taking plan b multiple times in one cycle which can mess your whole hormonal system. After a week I got some light spotting and a light period. A week after this which is today I have my period and I am not pregnant. Moral of my story: Plan b worked every time just make sure you take early as possible"
1.0,"I promised myself to come back to this website when my period comes. And here am i today. I had sex with my partner and took plan B as precaution the next day. And let me tell you, the pain I had was not worth it at all. I had really bad headache that took me back and forth to the clinic (may not happen to everyone). Also, did i mention how anxious i was for the whole month? I even bought pregnancy test (please don’t, because it’s just gonna waste your money), and it turned out negative. I even had a gut to buy it again (just please don’t). So girls, if you wanna do sex, ask them to use protection. But i do understand it sometimes broke and plan B is the best way for you. Hence, trust the pill. The pill gonna work for real and pleaseeee don’t stress yourself out too much because its going to delay your period even longer. "
1.0,I had unprotected sex the day after my ovulation cycle. I picked up Plan B the next morning and took it right away (about 12 hours after intercourse). I have taken this a few times (its worked every time) and never had any side effects but I would recommend taking with food and water. 5 days after taking this pill I tested negative on an at home pregnancy test. 3 days later I started my period (early- as it does mess with your cycle a bit). I am also over 200 lbs. I wanted to share my experience as this pill does work.

I went to Google to see if it was true, I know worst decision in my life, I saw all these things about how plan b doesn’t work on your ovulation so I started crying but then I found this website, and saw there are plenty of girls in the same boat as me. I bled and now I finally got my period! Trust the pill!!"
1.0,"Well I did the deed around 2:30 AM & He finished  in me. I checked my period tracker & since I had just finished my period 6 days prior I was on either day 2/3 or being fertile, meaning I was preparing to ovulate. I was freaking out because this was my first time this happened. Around 3:30 pm I took the Plan B pill so within 12/13 hours. The next week I was feeling nauseated, EXTREMELY bloated, had weird discharge. 4 days after my expected ovulation date, I was spotting pink & light brown & I swore it was implantation bleeding. At that point I was fully convinced I was pregnant. I took a few pregnancy test ( 12 days ) after I had unprotected sex  & it came up negative but that wasn't enough for me considering my body literally felt like it was early pregnancy symptoms. On my expected period day my back was giving me the worst pain off my life & the my period magically came. Don't google anything just believe in the pill!!"
1.0,"Hello, so I took Plan B the morning after having unprotected intercourse (obv) but the point is that my ovulation was due 2 days after unprotected sex. I started spotted 3 days after I took the pill and assumed it was a side effect or failed ovulation (idk what it was exactly). My period was late 6 days so I was definitely getting concerned and worried I was expecting. My period had finally came! I also used some manifesting or what not but in the end everything worked out to my favor. I wanna let y’all know everything is gonna be okay… seriously. The thought and process of even thinking you could possibly be a mother soon is very scary especially when you’re unprepared and very young like myself. I also promised myself I would come back and share some of the experience so that other young girls know they’re not alone. However, plz be safe and take care of yourselves… And remember to breathe and try to not stress!"
1.0,"hey guys I’m 22 years old I’m bf is 20 we had sex and we haven’t had sex in so long and it just felt amazing I had him cum inside me I know what y’all are thinking… like what I know RIGHT! And I’m not even on birth control plus he did it the day of my ovulation, which was worse so I took plan B ASAP. Lady’s let me tell you it was awful I was bloated I felt sick I felt like crap!!! and my mood swings was off the chainnn it felt like I was pregnant!!! But it’s crazy how you mind makes you think that. My period did some a few days late. The plan b does work please don’t listen to those google post about it doesn’t work if you take it during your ovulation. I took it my period still came just trust the pill! DO NOT PANIC and please  don’t be like me please have protected sex no matter how amazing it feels…"
1.0,"So my boyfriend and I had sex on February 14th with no protection and he pulled out and came after few seconds. I am a paranoid person so I began to stress out when I saw that I was in my fertile window (2 days before ovulation) and went to google immediately. That was my biggest mistake, don't do that!! It said that I can get pregnant even with precum. After 2 hours I made my boyfriend go and buy me a Plan B. Next two weeks were horrible because I was stressing myself out from reading all the pregnancy symptoms. 3 or 4 days before my period arrived, I've started to be nauseous and couldn't eat breakfast because I felt like I would throw up. My stomach was bloated all the time and it was very gassy. I even tried to check my cervix and it was high (it supposed to mean that I've conceived). I was about to buy myself pregnancy test this morning but I finally got my period (March 5th). Please don't worry and don't google your symptoms because they're all the same! This pill works 100%."
1.0,"DO NOT WORRY!!!! I WAS SO SCARED THIS WAS NOT GOING TO WORK BECAUSE THE CONDOM BROKE THE DAY BEFORE MY OVULATION DAY!! I track my period through the Flo app and given that the condom ripped and he ejaculated when it was a day before my set ovulation day, my boyfriend and I were both scared it wouldn’t work (being 18 I’m nowhere ready to have a kid). I took the Plan B about 2 hours after the incident. I felt no symptoms when I took it but about a week later I noticed I was a little bloated, was more emotional, fatigue, and I was EXTREMELY nauseated. I know people say these symptoms only happen 24h after u take the pill but that’s NOT true. Read almost all the other experiences with this pill and it’s true it DOES work and YOU will be OKAY!! It costs 50 dollars for a reason and don’t stress yourself out about it because  that can cause even more delay in your period besides the pill itself! YOU’LL BE ALRIGHT!❤️"
1.0,"Ladies, yes Plan B is a bit expensive, but it's absolutely worth it. If that's what you're thinking about just go pay it, it's worth the cost. Abortion is far more expensive and far worse of an experience. And having a baby of course is even more expensive. But more than anything your regret and anxiety is even worse! You will thank yourself later that you took it. I was skeptical if I got pregnant from that one time but all it takes is one time, so my logic finally kicked in and I ran to go get it. I had sex on Friday and didn't go until Monday morning to get Plan B and still got my period about 14 days later. It worked. I got it at my local Ralph's and you have to ask a store clerk to open their glass display case where it's locked up to give it to you. Just try to do nice meditations and breathing exercises and relax and trust that this pill does what it's supposed to. There are so many reviews here as proof. Also I don't know about the cheaper generic brands but I now love Plan B!"
1.0,"I'm going to be as detailed as possible because if you're someone like me you need every detail when you're stressing. First I want to ease your mind about side effects and tell you that despite all my fears, I had zero side effects. None. I braced for the worst and didn't have any side effects whatsoever. And my period started exactly on time. I had my normal PMS symptoms, nothing out of the ordinary. And my period has been normal, not heavy or anything like I feared. Here is my story: I had unprotected sex on February 11 (he ejaculated in me twice). My period was on February 1 so I had sex in my absolute most fertile time and took Plan B during ovulation. Online tells you it won't work during ovulation. Take it anyway, it still works! I'm proof. Never took Plan B before and was so scared and frozen and didn't know what to do that I didn't take Plan B until the 3rd day at 55th hour. I'm so glad I did. I had less anxiety about pregnancy waiting the last 2 weeks. GO GET IT NOW!!"
1.0,"UPDATE I made a review this morning and my period finally came!!! 13 days late, day 37 since my last period and now I’m finally starting to bleed. Going to take a pregnancy test probably tomorrow to confirm. But ladies, this pill works. My system was totally messed up and I’m nowhere NEAR wanting kids. My body took me through hell to get here, but it works."
1.0,"Like a lot of people on here I was so scared that plan b wouldn’t work, I had sex 6th Feb one day before I ovulated even though he pulled out I was so scared because of pre-cum. I took the pill 29 hours later, I was nauseous and had ovary pain and a bit of discharge and sore breasts. I got my period today 23rd Feb, I usually have 30 day cycles so I was 2 days late but had period cramps a few days before so I knew it was coming, vitamin c, yoga, and camomile, ginger tea, exercise induces your period quicker so try doing that!  Stay calm as stress will just make it later, it will work for you this site helps a lot and DO NOT LOOK UP SYMPTOMS!! Good luck ladies♥️"
1.0,"Before I get into my experience, GIRL YOU WILL BE FINE! I have used the plan b 3 times in one week and I promised myself that I would come back here to share my experience if it worked. I have a boyfriend and he came to visit me for two weeks we used condoms every time we had sex but for some reason they kept on breaking. Let’s  say this happened 3 times in 2 weeks and every time I took a plan b within the 48 hours. I googled like crazy what could happen and I came across many websites saying that a plan b would fail during ovulation. I started panicking cause those were the weeks of my suspected ovulation. As well as the side effects of taking plan b multiple times in one cycle which can mess your whole hormonal system. After a week I got some light spotting and a light period. A week after this which is today I have my period and I am not pregnant. Moral of my story: Plan b worked every time just make sure you take early as possible"
1.0,"I promised myself to come back to this website when my period comes. And here am i today. I had sex with my partner and took plan B as precaution the next day. And let me tell you, the pain I had was not worth it at all. I had really bad headache that took me back and forth to the clinic (may not happen to everyone). Also, did i mention how anxious i was for the whole month? I even bought pregnancy test (please don’t, because it’s just gonna waste your money), and it turned out negative. I even had a gut to buy it again (just please don’t). So girls, if you wanna do sex, ask them to use protection. But i do understand it sometimes broke and plan B is the best way for you. Hence, trust the pill. The pill gonna work for real and pleaseeee don’t stress yourself out too much because its going to delay your period even longer. "
1.0,I had unprotected sex the day after my ovulation cycle. I picked up Plan B the next morning and took it right away (about 12 hours after intercourse). I have taken this a few times (its worked every time) and never had any side effects but I would recommend taking with food and water. 5 days after taking this pill I tested negative on an at home pregnancy test. 3 days later I started my period (early- as it does mess with your cycle a bit). I am also over 200 lbs. I wanted to share my experience as this pill does work.
0.0,"Usually you have 7 days when your ovulating then 1 day of ovulation. I had sex before my ovulation day, so the plan b didn't work for me. I track my period through the fitbit app. When I checked the calendar it said I was ovulating and the second day would be my ovulation day. I decided to take plan b anyway but I knew it wasn't going to work because plan b works to stop you from ovulating, so if you are ovulating it won't work. If you didn't get pregnant when you were ovulating and you took the plan b it doesn't mean the plan b works it's just a red flag telling you that you may have issues getting pregnant in the future. Hope this helps."
1.0,"GUYS DON'T WORRY IT REALLY WORK
Had accident on my exact fertile day and took the pill in same day.
Had some pregnancy scare as everywhere in google said this won't work on ovulation day.
Like everyone on here said please just chill and not adding stress by reading that early pregnancy symptoms on the internet."
0.0,Last September (end of month) my boyfriend and I did the deed one night and the very next day (less than 24hrs) took a Plan B. 1-1.5 weeks later I had bleeding what I thought was my cycle and was mistaken. Weeks (about 5-6 Mid November) later in the ER for ectopic pregnancy (ruptured Fallopian tube) had to have emergency surgery. So yeah definitely did not work on top of that had an ectopic pregnancy.
1.0,"Promised myself I would come back on here to ease the minds of many as this was the only site that eased mine. Had totally unprotected sex on January 31st 2022 my husband fully came in me. I am not on any form of birth control. Checked my Flo app and was completely in my ovulation timeframe. Confirmed with white stretchy cervical mucus I was as fertile as I could be.  Took Plan B less than 12 hours after and researched and panicked for the next 2 weeks. Stay off google it will make you SICK with worry. Took 2 negative pregnancy test on 2/11 and 2/15 and just started my period this morning 2/17/22. Stay off other sites and trust these real stories. And yes I had every “pregnancy symptom” in the book. Tender breast, nausea, slight cramping. The hormones from the pill can cause these symptoms too. Hope this calms someone down!"
1.0,"I swore  I would come back here if I got my period. This has been the most stressful time of my life. 2 weeks ago, I was having sex with my boyfriend around my ovulation day (I'm not regular so I don’t know when it is). We did the deed and then next morning I took plan B. I had cramping and slight spotting, but the rest was okay. This is where it gets stressful. Exactly 7 days later, we did the deed again. We did not see that the condom has broken and he came fully inside of me. I was STRESSED. I had to take plan B 2 times in a week! I read that it becomes less effective when you take it many times. Unfortunately, we broke up the next day (he cheated on me - how fun). I had to deal with a break up and a pregnancy scare! I had multiple symptoms and I did not want to get pregnant from my ex at 19! I took multiple tests, all negative. Today, I got my period, early than planned. The pill works ladies, and more than one time!"
1.0,I promised myself I would come back to review if it worked. It did! I had been careless and 3 days later I took the pill (it was still in the 3 day recommended interval). 10 days later I had what looked like implantation bleeding that lasted for 5 days. After much agony I got my period 14 days late. Don’t go online and stress and cry like I did. It only makes it worse and it makes you think that you really are pregnant after a while. Good luck to you!
1.0,"Okay listen, I was literally so scared I was pregnant. Me and my boyfriend did the deed on the 31st of January . I was three days into ovulating and he didn’t use protection for the first time. We did it two times and he pulled out but wasn’t sure the 2nd time if it did in time. I took a Plan b about 12 hours later and I read online that isn’t affective when ovulating. I was so worried. I just can’t be pregnant. I had anxiety and was paranoid because I kept looking online and the symptoms I was having said I was pregnant. (cramping, bloated, horrible mood swings, craving food. etc.) then out of nowhere my period came 5 days later (February 5th). I got my last period around January  20th so I wasn’t expecting my period anytime soon .I even took a pregnancy test. Remember to stay calm and ladies let the pill do it’s magic. It really works. Don’t google anything because it will say your pregnant."
1.0,"As I promised.. I’m back! Had unprotected sex on 12/17 and 12/18 took a plan b on the 18 (days before ovulating). My expected period was on 01/8-01/10 but it was 23 days late!! I had taken plan b before but it never delayed my period this much. Best believe I was freaking out! I took about 3-4 pregnancy tests and they were all negative. Please please relax and think positively, if needed take a test after your missed period to get some peace of mind. You got this"
1.0,"Okay I’m gonna do a review . Y’all this pill works !! I had sex on January 21st, (unprotected he pulled out though) and it was 6 days before my period was due . Which was a low chance of getting pregnant but I wanted to be safe anyways . I took the pill the next day within 24 hours and I didn’t experience symptoms till a few days ago and my boobs were sore like they normally are on before my period . I calmed down these reviews helped me so much and it only delayed my period for 4 days . I just got it today !!❤️ Trust the process the pill, and don’t freak out to much you will be fine"
1.0,"Hey guys please trust the pill. It worked for me. But it delayed my periods for like six days. So girl don’t stress, the more you do so, the more your period blood doesn’t come. First day I had old blood coming out as spotting, dark red & brown. I went on Google and please stay away !!! Google showed up to mean I’m pregnant blah blah implantation… so girl you don’t wanna know all of that. Relax & trust the pill especially if you took it before time."
1.0,"I’m going to write this post because a lot of the reviews on here calmed me down a lot. I took a plan B because the condom slipped off inside me, and he was sure that he didn’t ejaculate yet but I saw so many posts and articles saying that precum can still get you pregnant. So, I took plan B 40 minutes after the sex. I didn’t really get any side effects from taking it. A week after taking it, I started getting brown discharge which was very similar to implantation bleeding and I was freaking out so much. It was too early to take a pregnancy test, so I waited a week to take one. I’m so glad I waited because I finally got my period ! this pill really does work and it’s really helpful to stay off of google and doing all the research about it."
1.0,It was my first time taking Plan B. The condom had come off so we a lil scared. I waited around 12 hours before actually taking. The symptoms for me personally started around 6 hours after the pill. I started getting cramps and my boobs became sore. After that I started getting pregnancy symptoms which freaked my boyfriend and I out a little. But in the end I ended up getting my period 2 days late. Trust in the pill and don’t overthink every little thing. Try not to stress either cause it’ll only delay your period causing you to stress even more. Trust me it happened to me. Also it was after I had ovulated but I didn’t wanna risk anything.
1.0,"Had unprotected sex the same day I ovulating. When I realized the condom broke, I immediately freaked out. I took the morning after pill 10 hours after the deed. I was so nervous when I read it didn’t work if you’re ovulating. I guess everyone’s body is different because it worked for me. My period was a day late, but it came and I’m so relieved. Trust in the pill!"
1.0,"First of all, get off of the reviews and just take the dang thing and trust it lol. I am in my mid 20s and married and I am not ready to have children just yet. My husband and I had sex on New Years and he fully went inside of me (with my consent) and I am not on any type on contraception. The next day according to my Flo app I realized it was one of my most fertile days leading to ovulation. I freaked out and asked my husband to purchase me some plan b and took it within 24 hours.  I spent the past few weekends anxious and googling everything and taking multiple pregnancy tests. Yesterday I started my period 2 days early and I felt fine. No excessive cramps or side effects or anything at all. I did have an excessive amount of discharge for the first week after the plan b though."
1.0,"***LADIES PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU ARE NERVOUS*** First off, get off Google, it will freak you out like it did to me! This is the only website that helped me so I swore I’d come back when I got my period. I’m on the pill, but was ovulating and also taking an antibiotic that DOES affect the pill. I had sex no condom on Dec 31, Jan 3, and Jan 4. On Jan 4 the guy was unsure if he came inside or not so I took plan b. It’s now Jan 16 and I got my period! I had every pregnancy symptom though - nausea, fatigued, headache, sore boobs, cramps. I swear I was pregnant but TRUST THIS PILL!"
1.0,"I promised I’d write a review if my period came and it officially did today! After having an accident on the 25th of December I took the pill that following Tuesday which was a little late to do so take it as soon as possible! But none the less I freaked out so much by over thinking so don’t try to stress yourself. I got my period after 46 days which was the longest in a while for me and don’t let others or the stupid internet scare you even more, stay calm you got this and talk to someone. 
Don’t do this alone. YOU GOT THIS!!!!"
1.0,"I had sex with my girlfriend twice during her ovulation circle. Immediately after our sweet sex we got the emergency contraceptive pill. We thought it won't work because we learnt from what we read online that the pills doesn't work during ovulation. She panicked and was worried sick. So finally after going for a test that came out negative, she saw her flow which came 2 weeks late. 
The pill worked but it sure delayed her menstrual period. 
So if you are reading this and you are faced with the same challenge, don't worry trust the pill and pray"
1.0,"Hey, everyone! Just like all the girls here I swore that once I get my period I'll come and write my experience here. I see most of the reviews here telling how bad the symptoms were for them and since I didn't show any side effects of the drug I was worried sick! 
I was in my most fertile days including the day of ovulation when I had unprotected sex and I took in a total of 3 pills throughout those days( I know, very stupid). I went insane every day trying to monitor every small change that was happening in my body and it honestly stresses you out. I just have to let you all know that don't worry, Plan B actually works! It works differently for different people. And for anyone wondering, I am a little bit on the heavier side and it worked completely fine for me."
1.0,"Alright this is only day 2 of taking Plan B and I am writing this review because anxiety is so hard on me. I know I shouldn't be lurking around on Google about this because it just makes me feel worst. Anyway I'm panicking because I think I was on my fertile window when the deed went down, my partner and I did 3 rounds on the same day and about 2 hours later got Plan B. As of right now I have not gotten that many symptoms aside from cramps that lasted 2 minutes and nausea which I think is just caused by my anxiety. Anyway I'm just really hoping this works and I will make sure to update you girls on how everything went. :'0"
1,"I'm 45 this is is my 5th implant absolutely loved it, no side effects whatsoever but after my 3rd implant I started getting migraines sickness mood swings, heavy bleeding, had it removed was put on the pill, fell pregnant after having my daughter I decided to give the implant another go which yet again no side effect but after my 5th implant which was put in last year, my mood swings got severe started getting hot & cold flushes so went back to the docs and only to be told the levels of the implant had affected my FSH hormone levels which were very high so its caused me to go into premenopause even though my pre menopause levels were ok I'm now having to have the implant taken out & being put on HRT treatment. My SIL and my nieces all have the implant with no problems at all."
1,"I had my first implant in 2007 and bled for months which I think was normal as the body was getting used to it. Then light bleeding. First 3 years was great. Had the second implant in 2020 then all I started having all kind of issues - mood swings, depression, crying for no reason, low sex drive and the worst part was really heavy blood clots and was admitted to the hospital in 2021 due to that. After that blood clot, I started bleeding for 2 weeks every months. It's 2022 now and I can't do it it anymore. I can't enjoy sex life, always cranky, moody and unhappy with life. Going to get it removed next week. It's a great implant to have, not to worry about pills, very cheap but not for everyone. I think everyone should try but if it doesn't work, take it out."
1,"My gynecologist recommended this IUD as I didn’t want to take a pill everyday, and also had thought about using a diaphragm (heavily outdated though), so I opted for Kyleena. Insertion didn’t really hurt but I did feel some pressure. My doc gave me an prescription before  for misoprostol which helped dilate my cervix so insertion wasn’t as painful (and it wasn’t), but it wasn’t a walk in the park thanks to my nerves. For the next few months, I’ve had mild side effects eg slight mood swings, irregular periods, mild acne, and twinges of cramps when my period was near. But that’s really all I’ve had. It made my periods lighter and the acne has since subsided. It’s been nearly six months and I really do like this IUD. Highly recommend it!"
1,"I just wanted to share my experience. For me personally, there was no pain at all when Kyleena was inserted (I do have two children, so that might be why), nor I had any significant pain in the days after. I am in Europe and there was no pain relief provided nor was it necessary. I had light spotting for a month and then couple of months of unpredictable period, which settled into a normal cycle at around three month mark. I now have slightly longer period but very very light flow. My skin did not get worse and I I did not gain weight. I have had a rough year so it is hard to say whether the IUD affected my mood. I have had it for a year now and I'm very happy with it. I do feel very sorry for people who have had terrible experience."
0,"I got Kyleena inserted towards the end of September and have had it now for 6 months. The insertion was painful, but definitely bearable. I bled/spotted lightly for about 3 months straight, and although long periods of bleeding, it was an extremely light flow. The concept of Kyleena is amazing and you can't even tell it's there. Fast forward to now, I am now developing severe anxiety, brain fog, and intense feelings of worry/paranoia which is interfering with my daily life. I experienced my first panic attack one month after insertion, with increased anxiety, but it was manageable and I expected things to get better with time. Now, this has become a daily struggle and I feel like I've lost my sense of self. Luckily I've never had any pain or cysts, no increase in acne, no dryness, and my libido has stayed the same. I'm sad I have to get it removed, but it is not worth the mental side effects."
1,"I came back here to try to see if there's anyone in the same position as me who's about to get it switched out for the first time, but I don't see any of that.  Anyway, I thought I'd share my experience for people trying to decide as I'm coming up on the 5 year mark of having it.

Pros: Little to no period after the first several months.  This is WAY nicer than I thought it was going to be. Zero pregnancy scares while having unprotected sex. Don't have to remember to take a pill.  

Cons: I have a very high pain tolerance and almost fainted after insertion, I really wasn't expecting that to be a problem for me.  I had some type of bleeding or spotting everyday for a good 6-7 MONTHS.  Again, after that basically no period for 4 years.  I did get acne that took me a year to figure out how to manage and I've never had acne before.  After 2 years I did gain quite a bit of weight I can't seem to lose.  I do have bad anxiety, but I've always struggled with this a little."
1,"I have had my Kyleena IUD in for 4 years.  Overall, I highly recommend this IUD.  It’s nice to not have to worry about birth control for 5 years.  I have not experienced any mood changes with this form of birth control, which I did experience with birth control pills.  Also, no weight gain or changes in libido.  The cons for me have been the following:  had heavy periods for the first 9 months, random cramping on and off especially the first year, oily skin (honestly, doesn’t bother me anymore since I know how to take care of my skin, my skin is already oily to begin with) and unpredictable spotting at times.  With all that said, I would get this same IUD because the pros outweigh the cons for me."
0,"The initial insertion was ok, and then I had a kind of brown sludge discharge that lasted for 4 months. It finally stopped, and the good news was my period had stopped along with it. I didn't notice many adverse effect until the 2.5 - 3 year mark. After having this in long term, my hormones went crazy. I developed panic attacks, anxiety, brain fog, insomnia, and have never had any of these things in my life. I spoke with many psychologists and finally upon advice from my therapist, I took the Kyleena out and had my hormones tested. My progesterone (calming hormone Kyleena releases) was almost 0. Your body becomes dependant on the birth control. If I had knows the havoc this would cause, I would have never gotten the IUD. Hormonal birth control can cause SO many long term problems doctors don't warm you about, and many of my friends had the same crash. If you do choose to get this IUD please please closely observe how it impacts your body. IMO NOT worth it at all."
1,I got Kyleena inserted about a month and a 1/2 ago. I forgot to take ibuprofen so I was very nervous about it. I tried to relax my body during the procedure to prevent pain as much as possible. It was 9/10 painful at the worst part and I bled a lot afterwards for two days. The first period afterwards was pretty painful and lasted two weeks with lots of painful cramps. My second period also has lots of painful cramps so far. I have tested the effectiveness three times and so far it works for birth control. I figure the pain and cramps will eventually subside within the next months. The cramps are extremely painful and ibuprofen and heat don’t help. I read all of these reviews before and knew it wasn’t going to be fun but I hope it’ll be worth it after my body adjusts.
1,"I want to share my experience because I know that I was reading patient experiences nonstop before I had my procedure! I had Kyleena placed a few days ago and I will admit that the placement was very painful. I became very hot and nauseated from the pain, but it dissipated shortly after the IUD was placed.  I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and a 0.5 mg tablet of alprazolam. I cramped a lot the same day, the cramps were pretty severe but nothing that ibuprofen couldn’t help. After my procedure, my physician did an ultrasound on me to ensure the IUD was in the correct spot, and it was! The next day, I had no cramps and no other symptoms! I highly recommend Kyleena! Don’t stress yourself out with the negative reviews. Everybody has a different body with different responses, so don’t assume that your body will have the same response as someone else :)"
1,"I noticed a persistent amount of acne along my jawline, below the corners of my mouth as well as on my back and neck while using Kyleena. I noticed a particular uptick of acne/blackheads after my period finally subsided (this took over 20 months to occur).  The same thing happened to me in my early 20s while on a hormonal IUD (Mirena)."
1,p>		“Had Mirena for 5 years inserting it was fine spotting occasionally for 3/4months then nothing except a rare spotting had it removed in December and replaced with Kleena. I only use it to control my bleeding. Insertion was incredibly sore this time but I think it was because I was ovulating and I normally get pain and swelling with it.  Then I bled in January for almost a week nothing in February but bleeding again now with cramps I hope it will go back to no bleeding as this is why I have it as I've been sterilised since my last c section”</p
1,"I have had my Kyleena for the full 5 years. Compared to other forms of birth control this is by far my favorite and affected me the least. That being said there still were some effects. After the incredibly painful but not unbearable insertion I bled for 2 months straight. After that I barely bled at all during my periods. If I took my adderall or sertraline they got much light and I might only spot for a day or 2. Stop the adderall and they come back. I did see an increase in anxiety and depression symptoms but cannot attribute it completely to Kyleena as there were other situational, environmental, medical and physical factors involved.  As far as BC goes this sucker is solid tho."
0,I have had the IUD in for 4 months. For the first three months I had severe stomach pains that were debilitating (I was on vacation - I still today have stomach pains and have to take at least 2 pain relievers a day. I have bled heavily from the start (I never had long or heavy periods in my life). I have noticed my weight has gone up and is so so hard to lose weight. I am constantly bloated and my boobs have grown two cup sizes up. I have been so tired for the past 4 months (I have gotten used to this fatigue) and in terrible moods. Booked in for removal.
1,"I've had my Kyleena for over 3 years and had it taken out almost 2 weeks ago. Please keep in mind everyone is different, and this is my personal experience. I loved Kyleena when I first got it and the duration for the following reasons. My acne got better, eventually my periods would either not show up or be very short like 2-3 days, I no longer experienced much cramping, and I didn't have any complications. Yes, the application and removal HURT! but only for a few moments. Now the negative effects that I experience were weight gain, severe irritability,  varied lengths of depression episodes, and insomnia. Having taken it out I've been slightly more emotional and sensitive, but I'm assuming that's my hormones. However I've had an extreme burst of energy since it's been removed. I do recommend it, but beware the moods."
1,"I just got my Kyleena iud removed after 4.5 years. Once inserted, I spotted for about 30 days and never had another period for the duration of having Kyleena. I got the MOST PAINFUL ovarian cyst and it took about 3 months to go away. Worst. Pain. Ever. Then my skin went from dry to OILY. So oily. Especially my eyelids. Then I developed eczema on my eyelids due to the excess oil production. I lost hair by the chunks. My hair is about 1/4 of the thickness it use to be 4.5 years prior. I gained about 5lbs per YEAR. So I was 120 when inserted and the heaviest I got was 150 around year 4 and then started exercising and eating healthy and the lowest I could get down to was 140 (which was SO HARD, it was not hard for me prior to Kyleena) I nearly completely lost my sex drive and became very detached emotionally around year 3-4. Now after 24 hours after removal and I’m having the weirdest uterine spasms and light withdraw bleeding. Removal was very very easy and painless."
0,"I have had this IUD for a year and a half. The insertion was unbearable. IMO pushing a whole baby out of my vagina was less painful (probably bc I was able to take real pain meds instead of a low dose of iBuprofen). I have “spotted” the entire time. My gynecologist even prescribed pills and IB to stop the bleeding, which it did, but maybe only for a week. I have periodic slight cramping, even when I’m not on my period and occasional clotting discharge. About a month ago, my breasts were so sore they felt like they were on fire. They have never felt like that since I was pregnant, so of course I was terrified and took a pregnancy test. Thank goodness I wasn’t pregnant! But still scary. The main reason I decided to have the IUD inserted was to hopefully have no periods. My regular periods without birth control were light and only lasted 3 days. Now I have been bleeding for almost 2 years straight. I plan to have this removed very soon and use a different birth control method."
0,"I have had Kyleena in since 2017. The insertion wasn’t terrible, I felt cramps during insertion but then was given meds and had cramps for the remainder of the day. I did have periods while having it and my cramps (which were pretty much non-existent before Kyleena) were extremely painful right before I would get my period. I experienced extreme side-effects from having the IUD such as weight loss, depression, and severe anxiety. I will say I never had a problem with getting pregnant as the IUD did it’s job. I will be getting it out in April due to the side-effects I can just not deal with anymore. I honestly do not recommend this to anyone at a younger age as I got mine when I was 16 and it is still effecting my mood everyday, even when I’m not on my period. It worked for not getting my pregnant but the side-effects are just not worth it."
0,"I got the Kyleena about a year and a half ago.  Insertion was terrible. Cramping, pinching, light headed, and intense stomach pain. I gave it a few days thought that it would go away. I ended up cramping on and off the whole time. But I thought that was okay to have the satisfaction of no protection and no periods. Fast forward I decided to get it removed when my boyfriend began getting cuts during sex. Not to mention the mood swings, dry vagina, frequent yeast infections and UTIs. They attempted to go in 2 times to remove it. They couldn’t find it. They took an ultrasound and spotted it and attempted to go in AGAIN to remove it. They were using all kinds of clamps to find it. And could not find the strings. Finally they decided I needed to go under to have it surgically removed. That was today. I had it surgically removed today. They found it attached to my uterus with the string wrapped all around it. DO NOT GET THE IUD"
0,"So I just want to start this off by saying I’m sure Kyleena works for some but not for everyone. I don't do well with hormones. When I was researching I found ParaGard. Which had no hormones. I went to my gynecologist and I told her I wanted the Paragard and absolutely no hormones. She mentioned  kyleena but I still said I didn’t want any hormones. So I thought we agreed on ParaGard. I get the IUD inserted and it was painful something I never felt before but nothing I couldn’t live with. I have really bad cramping in the beginning, then it got better. After the 2 1/2 month came around I would get random swings of extreme depression and anxiety. It was affecting my personal and professional life. I thought I was going crazy. I later found out she put the wrong one at it was kyleena. Ladies I really recommend being very stern with what you want to your doctors and before you do anything is going to mess with your hormones. Get them tested to see if it will work with your body."
0,"I'm on my 5th year of the Kyleena. I'm having it removed tomorrow. 

Insertion: Hurt so bad. I believe I was given Naproxen (Aleve) prior to the appointment, but it didn't help. The doctor actually laughed at me and scolded me, asking me how I'd ever have children if I couldn't even handle this. Um, excuse me, but isn't the point of getting the IUD to NOT have children? Anyway, it hurt, and I recall feeling like I was being split in half. I think I cramped for a few days afterwards. 

Since insertion: Chronic pelvic pain (due to tight pelvic floor muscles. Could be due to the IUD as it started a month after), a cyst rupture, surgery to test for endometriosis (due to the pelvic floor pain), bloating, really light, short periods (yay), and possibly mood swings. I'm not entirely sure if the mood swings are caused by the IUD, but I guess I'll find out after this week. 

4/10. Never had pelvic floor pain prior to the insertion of the IUD. Now my uterus is the bane of my existence."
1,"I had Kyleena placed about 10 months ago and overall am happy I did it! However, I LOVED my pill and sad that I  having to change to a progestin-only option, though the gyno convinced me it was necessary (I’m a clotting risk & have family hx of breast cancer). I picked Kyleena as I am a smaller person that has never given birth and I preferred the low dose option over Mirena. When I went in for the insertion it was definitely uncomfortable and painful, but super quick. I took about 800 mg of ibuprofen an hour beforehand and brought a stress ball to squeeze... haha. Immediately after, I had some cramping and discomfort that lasted a few days and the spotting progressed to a heavier bleed as I was beginning to have ovulating periods again. Now that it’s been almost a year, I get some bad cramps at times before a (nonexistent) period (very light spotting). The cramps are manageable with midol! Mirena gave my sister cystic acne, but I have kept my clear skin with kyleena and my libido is back!"
0,"I had it inserted early December 2021. I basically had to sing because while I was on two pain medications it wasn't enough and felt like I was getting stabbed down there during the insertion and nearly passed out. For the next 5 weeks I was bleeding heavily and cramping, my hips and back were hurting all the time including a comfortable sleeping position so I go to sleep in pain, my libido just disappeared and I went into a heavy severe depression with horrible  mood swings and suicidal thoughts for no reason. My gyno dismissed this as ""It's just the hormones, this just takes time"" and he canceled my last appointment to see if there's anything wrong with the IUD. I just wanted to stop my heavy periods and PMDD. I didn't know it was going to be like this."
0,"I had my iud inserted in April 2021. It did lighten the flow of my period a little BUT I have had my period since I had it inserted. Yes that is right 9 months straight! Between April 2021 and January 2022 I only had a total of 12 days period free. Which was great but I never knew when I would start bleeding again. Sex made my period start again as well. It wasn't just a little blood it was a regular heavy flow. Also, it was very difficult to keep any size tampon inserted. Between January 2022 and today I didn't have my period for 2 weeks then had sex and then it was back. Also, gained 20 pounds. I am very active and went to the gym 5 days a week. The weight would not come off. Getting it removed today!"
0,"I've had the kyleena over a year. 

It was good at the start then I started getting depression and anxiety waves. Before I knew it they were constant to the point I have an appointment booked for Saturday the 26 Feb, 2022 because I'd rather be off contraceptives and have my partner wear condoms and unprotected period sex because very very low chances there. 

Anyway. My partner picked up on the mood swings and more depression and anxious. 

In saying that. I have a history of depression and anxiety and when you do your research it states IUDs hormones ones have increased risk of the depression and anxiety and same with other hormones contraceptives. 

It's great if you don't have the history and all, but be very in tune with yourself and all because before you know it, you can end up like me. Constantly depression and anxiety waves for no good reasons. It's not healthy for me to be like this and I cannot wait to get this thing out"
0,"I'm finally gaining the courage to take it out. I've had it for a little over a year now, cervical shock when I had it put in. Passed out in the elevators leaving the appointment. Really rough six months afterwards. Cramping, suddenly I had ovulation pain that I'd never had before, acne, crazy painful breasts...but the reason I'm having it removed is the anxiety. My anxiety has been astronomical since getting this thing. Had my first panic attack after having it placed. Was told by several doctors it shouldn't have that effect but here we are."
0,"So I had paragard for 6 years I didn't want hormones because I'm super sensitive to them. I couldn't take the pain anymore with that one, I have bad cramps to begin with and it made it worse. 

My doc convinced me to try kyleena. I was nervous because I don't like hormones. Well, turns out I was right and I'm down right miserable. 

I've had it for 7 months. I've gained 12lbs and I'm an avid work out person who watches what they eat and it's almost impossible to lose weight. I feel bloated all the time. I have almost no libido which was never an issue. Vaginal dryness drives me insane which also wasn't an issue. And for me, I have the worst armpit and breast pain I've ever experienced. It won't end until my period comes. So I'm just in pain all month practically. It hurts to put deodorant on and put a bra on. I can't take it anymore so I will have it removed. 

I still have bad cramps so the hormones didn't help that and only gave me more issues."
1,"My gynecologist recommended this IUD as I didn’t want to take a pill everyday, and also had thought about using a diaphragm (heavily outdated though), so I opted for Kyleena. Insertion didn’t really hurt but I did feel some pressure. My doc gave me an prescription before  for misoprostol which helped dilate my cervix so insertion wasn’t as painful (and it wasn’t), but it wasn’t a walk in the park thanks to my nerves. For the next few months, I’ve had mild side effects eg slight mood swings, irregular periods, mild acne, and twinges of cramps when my period was near. But that’s really all I’ve had. It made my periods lighter and the acne has since subsided. It’s been nearly six months and I really do like this IUD. Highly recommend it!"
1,"I just wanted to share my experience. For me personally, there was no pain at all when Kyleena was inserted (I do have two children, so that might be why), nor I had any significant pain in the days after. I am in Europe and there was no pain relief provided nor was it necessary. I had light spotting for a month and then couple of months of unpredictable period, which settled into a normal cycle at around three month mark. I now have slightly longer period but very very light flow. My skin did not get worse and I I did not gain weight. I have had a rough year so it is hard to say whether the IUD affected my mood. I have had it for a year now and I'm very happy with it. I do feel very sorry for people who have had terrible experience."
0,"I got Kyleena inserted towards the end of September and have had it now for 6 months. The insertion was painful, but definitely bearable. I bled/spotted lightly for about 3 months straight, and although long periods of bleeding, it was an extremely light flow. The concept of Kyleena is amazing and you can't even tell it's there. Fast forward to now, I am now developing severe anxiety, brain fog, and intense feelings of worry/paranoia which is interfering with my daily life. I experienced my first panic attack one month after insertion, with increased anxiety, but it was manageable and I expected things to get better with time. Now, this has become a daily struggle and I feel like I've lost my sense of self. Luckily I've never had any pain or cysts, no increase in acne, no dryness, and my libido has stayed the same. I'm sad I have to get it removed, but it is not worth the mental side effects."
1,"I came back here to try to see if there's anyone in the same position as me who's about to get it switched out for the first time, but I don't see any of that.  Anyway, I thought I'd share my experience for people trying to decide as I'm coming up on the 5 year mark of having it.

Pros: Little to no period after the first several months.  This is WAY nicer than I thought it was going to be. Zero pregnancy scares while having unprotected sex. Don't have to remember to take a pill.  

Cons: I have a very high pain tolerance and almost fainted after insertion, I really wasn't expecting that to be a problem for me.  I had some type of bleeding or spotting everyday for a good 6-7 MONTHS.  Again, after that basically no period for 4 years.  I did get acne that took me a year to figure out how to manage and I've never had acne before.  After 2 years I did gain quite a bit of weight I can't seem to lose.  I do have bad anxiety, but I've always struggled with this a little."
1,"I have had my Kyleena IUD in for 4 years.  Overall, I highly recommend this IUD.  It’s nice to not have to worry about birth control for 5 years.  I have not experienced any mood changes with this form of birth control, which I did experience with birth control pills.  Also, no weight gain or changes in libido.  The cons for me have been the following:  had heavy periods for the first 9 months, random cramping on and off especially the first year, oily skin (honestly, doesn’t bother me anymore since I know how to take care of my skin, my skin is already oily to begin with) and unpredictable spotting at times.  With all that said, I would get this same IUD because the pros outweigh the cons for me."
0,"The initial insertion was ok, and then I had a kind of brown sludge discharge that lasted for 4 months. It finally stopped, and the good news was my period had stopped along with it. I didn't notice many adverse effect until the 2.5 - 3 year mark. After having this in long term, my hormones went crazy. I developed panic attacks, anxiety, brain fog, insomnia, and have never had any of these things in my life. I spoke with many psychologists and finally upon advice from my therapist, I took the Kyleena out and had my hormones tested. My progesterone (calming hormone Kyleena releases) was almost 0. Your body becomes dependant on the birth control. If I had knows the havoc this would cause, I would have never gotten the IUD. Hormonal birth control can cause SO many long term problems doctors don't warm you about, and many of my friends had the same crash. If you do choose to get this IUD please please closely observe how it impacts your body. IMO NOT worth it at all."
1,I got Kyleena inserted about a month and a 1/2 ago. I forgot to take ibuprofen so I was very nervous about it. I tried to relax my body during the procedure to prevent pain as much as possible. It was 9/10 painful at the worst part and I bled a lot afterwards for two days. The first period afterwards was pretty painful and lasted two weeks with lots of painful cramps. My second period also has lots of painful cramps so far. I have tested the effectiveness three times and so far it works for birth control. I figure the pain and cramps will eventually subside within the next months. The cramps are extremely painful and ibuprofen and heat don’t help. I read all of these reviews before and knew it wasn’t going to be fun but I hope it’ll be worth it after my body adjusts.
1,"I want to share my experience because I know that I was reading patient experiences nonstop before I had my procedure! I had Kyleena placed a few days ago and I will admit that the placement was very painful. I became very hot and nauseated from the pain, but it dissipated shortly after the IUD was placed.  I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and a 0.5 mg tablet of alprazolam. I cramped a lot the same day, the cramps were pretty severe but nothing that ibuprofen couldn’t help. After my procedure, my physician did an ultrasound on me to ensure the IUD was in the correct spot, and it was! The next day, I had no cramps and no other symptoms! I highly recommend Kyleena! Don’t stress yourself out with the negative reviews. Everybody has a different body with different responses, so don’t assume that your body will have the same response as someone else :)"
1,"I noticed a persistent amount of acne along my jawline, below the corners of my mouth as well as on my back and neck while using Kyleena. I noticed a particular uptick of acne/blackheads after my period finally subsided (this took over 20 months to occur).  The same thing happened to me in my early 20s while on a hormonal IUD (Mirena)."
1,p>		“Had Mirena for 5 years inserting it was fine spotting occasionally for 3/4months then nothing except a rare spotting had it removed in December and replaced with Kleena. I only use it to control my bleeding. Insertion was incredibly sore this time but I think it was because I was ovulating and I normally get pain and swelling with it.  Then I bled in January for almost a week nothing in February but bleeding again now with cramps I hope it will go back to no bleeding as this is why I have it as I've been sterilised since my last c section”</p

I have almost no libido which was never an issue. Vaginal dryness drives me insane which also wasn't an issue. And for me, I have the worst armpit and breast pain I've ever experienced. It won't end until my period comes. So I'm just in pain all month practically. It hurts to put deodorant on and put a bra on. I can't take it anymore so I will have it removed. 

I still have bad cramps so the hormones didn't help that and only gave me more issues."
0,I do not recommend Kyleena. I previously had Mirena but it was big and became implanted in my uterus. I was told that Kyleena was better because it was smaller. I read all the reviews on her prior to getting it and gave it a year to see if my side effects disappeared. They did not. I developed an ovarian cyst for the first time after getting this IUD. It put me out of work for weeks. I got another ovarian cyst this past month that was 7 cm. I went to my OB-GYN to get it checked out and ended up having to be rushed into emergency surgery to remove the cyst. I have now switched to Annovera. I would not recommend this IUD.
0,"I got Kyleena about a month ago and immediately had a bad reaction to it. Started sweating, bad cramps, and non stop bleeding. I have now developed pretty bad anxiety when I had gotten my anxiety very well under control for the past 7 months. Now I get dizzy spells nearly everyday and feel like I'm going to black out, it's hard to breathe and just a lot of brain fog. I know some people love it but personally I have had a bad experience."
0,"Please do not ever get kyleena. It has been the absolute worst thing to happen to me. From extreme pain during insertion, to developing ovarian cysts, to worsening my anxiety to a point where it is unmanageable, and finally causing extreme acne. I am scheduled to have it removed finally after doctors telling me to keep it. The absolute worst health decision I ever made. Please be careful."
0,"Had the Mirena before the Kyleena and loved it, no issues. I went to have my Mirena changed but because the Mirena is slightly bigger for some reason the nurse was unable to insert it again. I was told to come back in a week and she would try again. It didn’t work again so she suggested the Kyleena. Smaller, the same king of  hormones as Mirena but less. Sounded perfect. Absolutely the worst decision I ever made.

The first month was fine but come the second month I felt extremely tired and had a low mood. My hair started coming out in clumps in my brush. I lost over half of my hair thickness and had to have it all cut off. Bad anxiety and usually I was a really upbeat person.

I decided to remove it yesterday. Having a break to reset my body and am planning on going back on the Mirena. These contraceptions obviously have different effects for different people so do research before and if you get bad side effects remove as soon as you can.

Hope this helps x"
1,DON’T listen to the negative reviews!! I got Kylenna inserted yesterday during my period and the insertion felt like a 30 sec period cramp. I took 3 advil before and was completely fine. Very fast and not too painful. My period slowed down tremendously after insertion. I’ve had a few mild cramps so far.
0,"I used to fully support any birth control until I had kyleena inserted in 2019 pain was horrible for a few hours, my period was on for about 3 months so I would take birth control pills just to make it stop.  The doctor told me to wait 6 months.  Anyway I kept it only because they kept saying to wait. I had periods 2 x a month for 10 days with horrible cramps, when before it only last 3 days max and no cramps.  After 1 year it finally stopped but I developed anxiety which I never had before and mood swings were so bad I literally started to dislike myself.  I kept getting yeast infections even when I wasn’t having sex, that was enough for me so I finally got it removed in 2021 September and my body is back to normal. I don’t even get sad like I used to and no more deadly cramps lol ,thinking of going back to the patch had no problems.  I wouldn’t recommend this one."
1,"The thing with contraception is that it works differently for every person. I tried pills, an arm implant, another IUD… Nothing felt right until Kyleena. I’m on my second now and I absolutely love it. Yeah, putting it in is painful - I was in terrible pain for about 2 days. But there’s also a benefit: I hardly get a period anymore. Before, I had periods so painful, I had to skip school / work for 2-3 days every month and lie in bed with a hot water bottle in total agony. Kyleena completely eliminated that issue. It works for me and I recommend it to my friends, but I’m fully aware that it might not work for them. Everyone is different and ultimately these online reviews are utterly pointless. You just have to keep trying until you find something that works for you."
0,"I got Kyleena shortly after I had my daughter so that I could take the time to enjoy her before we decided to have another baby. Since I went through labor, apparently the insertion of Kyleena isn’t as painful, which was my experience. Slight discomfort from what I could remember. I got it put in in 2019 and was still breast feeding. I lost a bit of weight due to breast feeding and got down to around 105lbs, I have now gotten up to 145-150lbs and am so uncomfortable. I take my daughter for long walks, go on 3-5 mile runs, work out here and there, go to the zoo, easy hikes with my daughter and my dog and I just keep gaining weight. I’m even on a prescription stimulant for ADHD and I’m STILL gaining weight!! Oh and there are days that I’m so tired and depressed I seriously can’t get out of my pjs and don’t want to get out of bed!! My hair is brittle and falling out and I have tons of brain fog. I have had it removed a few days ago and am hoping these things resolve themselves."
1,"Incredible. Insertion wasn't that painful, I had nearly no spotting after, and have had NO SIDE EFFECTS. And I get side effects from every medicine (I went off hormonal birth control because it worsened my anxiety and depression). 

I don't get my period, never worry about pregnancy, and have not gotten acne (despite acne prone skin). I am 21. 

I highly recommend trying this, don't trust the horror stories; happy patients don't write medication reviews."
0,"I had Skyla for the full three years and let me tell you I would not recommend this to anyone. EVER. I never had bad acne prior to getting Skyla and since getting it I've had awful acne, worse then I've ever had. My mood swings were terrible and the pain I had from it for the full three years was an awful experience. The pain would radiate down my legs and I would have to be balled up in a fetal position until the cramp subsided. My periods where never regular and always heavy through out the entire three years. I already had anxiety and depression prior too but my anxiety and depression got a lot worse since having Skyla. My depression got more dark. My anxiety more high and my will to be around people almost non-existent, even around my SO. I would have panic attacks in the middle of the night for no absolute reason, granted I have in the past as well but with Skyla they were a lot more frequent and I couldnt figure out why. I got it out the other day and since my pain has subsided."
0,It failed. I had Skyla inserted on 12/8 and wound-up conceiving around 12/17.
0,"This was my first experience with an IUD. Got it inserted 3 months ago, now removing it because the cramps have become absolutely unbearable. I had no cramps before getting it inserted and now it has me crying at 5 am…there are other side effects that I’m not a fan of but everyone is different."
0,"I have tried every single other form of birth control by 31 and everyone has had terrible side effects. I had such high hopes for Skyla from what I had read and been told. 
I gave it a SOLID chance (9 months) before digging into the timeline of things and realizing shortly after getting this is when I gained weight, my hair started thinning, suddenly got cystic acne, cramps were unbearable (and I've had the copper IUD cramps!), and worst of all for the first time in my life was put on bipolar medication and was suicidal three separate occasions (has never happened before). 
I'm getting this taken out today and I'm greatly looking forward to letting my body settle. I hope to get some mental and physical relief."
0,"I had Skyla in for a month and had a pretty terrible experience.  I'm 18 and very sensitive to hormones (I have PMDD), so that may be why it affected me so badly.  I had extreme mood swings, and worsened depression and anxiety.  It also gave me acne and fatigue.  Also my boyfriend said he could feel the strings."
0,"I had the Skyla inserted in 11/2018. Within the first 6 months I gained 60 lbs which I initially attributed to stress because I had only been told IUDs do not affect weight. Insertion was very painful and for the first 6 months after insertion, I had daily pain and cramping in the afternoons. Once that went away I loved the IUD. My periods turned into monthly spotting. At about a year after insertion I started noticing migraines and ovarian cyst pain that was worse than any period cramping I had previously experienced. I started seeking medical help to lose the weight I had gained. I tracked meals and exercise, talked to my primary care physician, a naturopathic doctor, an endocrinologist, and several nutritionists and dieticians. None of them could explain why I wasn’t losing weight. I had my IUD taken out in April of 2021 and by May I had lost 10 lbs. I have lost a total of 20lb since then and it’s still dropping. Look at studies on how IUDs affect cortisol."
1.0,Best birth control. No side effects for over 4 years.
1.0,I was put on Lo Lo to stop bleeding. Well 9 days and no change - the bleeding actually  seems worse. Praying it stops so tired of bleeding. I didn't like the depo.
1.0,"I've been on LoLo for two months and this is my first time ever being on birth control. I started the 1st pack on the 1st day of my period but it lasted 4 extra days past its usual time. Slight breast tenderness at first but it went away. My PMS moodiness was much better. My period came on on the last 4 pills but it was very light; I barely needed a pad. On my second pack, I had some light spotting between Days 13-17 (on the active combination pills). I'm 33 years old with a BMI of 30. 

I'm having to switch to another brand because LoLo is on backorder everywhere near me, but I've had a pleasant experience so far."
1.0,"I was on Lo Loestrin Fe for a little over a year. Honestly I didn’t have very many side effects except for low libido/dryness and irregular periods. My periods were so irregular, I'd get a period in the middle of my pack and sometimes I’d go months without them. It kinda sucked because I would never know if I was pregnant or not because I didn’t know when my period was supposed to come. Since I had low libido I experienced terrible dryness which is uncomfortable and embarrassing :/ . my skin was always super clear on it though!! Everyone’s different so if you’re thinking about trying it just do it"
0.0,"I took this because a nurse practitioner recommended it for heavy periods. It did make my flow lighter for the most part, HOWEVER- I had breakthrough bleeding 3/4 months on it, lasting probably a total of 10-15 days out of the month. Enough to need to wear a pad. I have been more depressed than I ever have been in my life. I have had panic attacks frequently, which were never that big of a problem for me. The worst part has been weight gain. I have gained 5 pounds in 4 months despite the fact that my weight had been stable for 7 years. I am constantly hungry - actually starving to the point of sickness if I don't eat. It didn't change my libido, but I don't want to engage in intercourse if I'm bleeding. I will stop this birth control and seek an ablation. Plus, it's extremely expensive and most insurance plans don't cover it. I am mad at the nurse practitioner for recommending this pill."
1.0,"I went on Lolo when I was 16 to help with acne and heavy flow. Needless to say I’m still on it 8 years later. It stopped my period all together after a month or so. Saw my gyno because of it and was cleared since this can happen with lolo. Before this birth control, I was going through 5 or more super plus tampons a day. So I can’t complain about the lack of period. In terms of acne reducing, this is where it  loses some points. It did help reduce my cystic acne, but it didn’t clear my skin either. I had to go on spironolactone a couple years later to actually clear my skin completely. Regarding weight change, I did not see any huge change. I do struggle with weight loss, but I also have a hypothyroid. With mental health, depression runs in my family genetically, and surprisingly it did not increase any intrusive thoughts. It actually  helped regulate them. 
Birth control is different for everyone since every body is different. I’d recommend giving it  try!"
1.0,"I've been on Lo Lo estrin for 8 years! Absolutely best birth control I've been on! Was skeptical at first to the idea of no period, but loved that fact after several months. Never got pregnant while on it. No mood swings. No weight gain. No acne! Wish my insurance didn't make me have to change"
1.0,"I was weary to start BC because I had heard a lot of bad things. Loestrin took a couple weeks to get used to. It caused me to have mood swings, nausea, and fatigue. However, after a couple of weeks it got better. I no longer feel nauseas and my mood is more stable than before I went on the pill. I recommend getting the app “Flo” and setting a pill reminder for a certain time each day. I haven’t gained a pound. Push through the first month or so. Overall,I’ve had a great experience."
1.0,"I will start by saying that I used to loathe birth controls  and was an advocate to natural periods. Life taught me a lesson. I was diagnosed and had surgery for Endometriosis in April 2021. After surgery the doctor told me the endo would come back if I didn't start hormonal therapy to suppress my periods. I was against it and waited until August to convince myself to start LoLo. My biggest fear was weight gain. I am so glad I gave this a try. This pill stabilized my hormone levels and made me feel better than I ever have in 7 years investigating my pain and hormonal issues. No more crazy mood swings. No more heavy debilitating periods. No more 10 days of misery of PMDD. Side effects I noticed: Nausea, headache, sore breasts and bloating. They all went away within the first 3 months. I still experience some bloating and sore breasts around my period, nothing unbearable. Due to stable hormones, I was able to lose 10 lbs already. This pill changed my life for the better."
1.0,"p>		“I'm in the first week of my third month of LoLoestrin and it just hit me that my extreme fatigue and depression may be a result of this pill. The first month, I had spotting for two weeks but no painful period and last month, no period at all but some cramping and PMS. I mean, I love not having terrible painful periods but my body feels like a slab of cement that I need a crane to lift out of bed every morning. I've gained five pounds but the chin acne went away after month one. I'm 48 and trying to ease the symptoms of my endo until menopause but I'm not sure I can hang in for this for much longer. For now, I'm going back to bed.”</p"
1.0,"My experience was strange only because I have always been use to the regular side effect of BC: heavy flow, full 7 days or more of flow, pms, and headaches. However THIS Birth control is 100% opposite. If I do get a pms moment it’s short, I crave chocolate but that’s pretty normal for me as I crave junk regularly. I get a period that doesn’t even require tampons/liners and only experience a full period ever 3 months or so, never experience cramps , or back aches. Also someone who experiences regular anxieties this didn’t seem to trigger any changes in my mood at all, no increase in anxiety or depression. So far so good. My experience so far as of 4 years"
0.0,"** DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL ** 

If you have any underlying mental health issues/anxiety or anything I do not recommend this pill at all. 
I have pretty mild anxiety, I don’t take anything for it, but I do not suffer from depression. 
I took Lo Lo and immediately, the first day of taking it I got depression symptoms. By day 2 and 3 I had suicidal thoughts and I have NEVER in my life been suicidal. Literally nothing was wrong but I was uncontrollably sobbing every day and having suicidal thoughts. It was the most messed up feeling like I couldn’t even function any more. It took me 4 days to realize it was the Lo Lo so I stopped and I am finally feeling better. I could not believe how awful the symptoms were so I had to leave a review to let anyone considering Lo Lo to know what it can do to your mental health."
1.0,"I am on lo loestrin for endometriosis. I have lots of GI symptoms from endo but also had super painful, heavy periods. I have only been on lo lo for 2 months and while it helps the GI symptoms and makes my periods lighter they are still extremely painful. It is helpful till I have my endo excision surgery but after I probably won't take it."
0,I started Spintec over a year ago. Since the start I was painfully dry. Sex was extremely uncomfortable and I felt like my vagina wasn’t even cleaning its self anymore. There was never any sort of wetness. I gained 20 pounds however that could have been a combination of my antidepressants too. I’ve been off this medicine a few days now and I’m already producing some wetness again.
0,This pill is not for me. I did not miss it once since I started. After being on it for 3 weeks I started bleeding. It's over a week and I am bleeding continuously. My period usually lasts for 5 days so this is for sure not my period. It is extremely frustrating!! I wish someone would have warned me about this side effect.
1,"Let me start this by saying, everybody is different, and WILL react differently to anything hormonal. I started Sprintec in 2017 at the age of 16. It was my first ever pill and it wasn’t that bad. I took it as religiously as I could (only missed a pill or two, and if I did miss one I took it early the following day), and had little side effects. GRANTED, before getting on it I barely had a period, and when I did it varied drastically. Sprintec never made my period easier, it just made it regular. I still had it for 5-6 days, and it was moderate. I had bad cramps the first three days but the rest of the cycle was easy. I’ve always had anxiety, but Sprintec did make my worries more active than usual. I never got pregnant, and I was definitely happy about that! However, in 2021 as a 21 year old I had to switch birth control, as I experienced break through bleeding. Then my doctor prescribed me Junel FE (worst thing ever)."
0,"I'm a 33 years old, healthy, petite female. I eat extremely healthy, do not smoke or drink, and lead an extremely active life.
I've been taking Sprintec for over 4 years. I started feeling sick and went to the ER, all COVID and flu tests came back negative. 
Due to my cough and other symptoms, they did blood work and did a scan of my belly.
Good new, no COVID, bad news, you have a pulmonary embolism. The doctor found several small blood clots in my left lung. I literally cried myself into a panic attack. 
They kept me in the ER for 3 days an IV of Heparin in 1 arm, saline in the other, had blood withdrawn every 6ish hours, and then was placed on another oral blood thinner called Eliquis when discharged.
As of now, I have to take blood thinners for 3 - 6 months, maybe longer.
You don't think it'll happen to you until it does. I caught mine early, and I hope this saves my life. But I'm writing this to warn others. My life has been thrown into chaos and fear. Find something safer"
1,"I am writing this review to help others. Absolutely everyone's bodies are different to medications. I have been on this pill on and off since I was 14 years old, I am now 23 years old. I recently started it back up consistently for the past 4 years. I would recommend this pill to anyone with all honesty. I went through a lot of changes in my life on this pill so I cannot pin point actually pros and cons. However, my experience has always been normal and good. Until now this past year have I decided but no other choice to switch the pill. I have tried everything but switched my pill. Out of nowhere a started to have a dark cloud over me and sluggish, lack of interest. I have started to become another person in my opinion. Also very low libido has begin this past year. To a point I don't even want to be touched. With that being said I am sure that it is because my body has changed overtime and my hormones. My overall experience has been great with this pill. Sad to change."
1,"I started Sprintec about a year ago, and I have nothing but positive things to say, I LOVE IT! I have a severe fear of gaining weight, my biggest fear starting birth control is that I would gain 20 or 30 pounds because most of the people I knew said they gained weight on the pill. When I started, I gained maybe 5 pounds at most the first month then it went away as soon as my body adjusted! My boobs didn’t grow, my period cramps are so much lighter, my skin is clear for the most part but I occasionally break out on my chin. Overall it didn’t effect my body in negative ways at all. Great for preventing pregnancy, (which is also a fear of mine right now lol), honestly I would recommend this pill to everyone!"
1,"I’m on my second month of Sprintec, and i just wanted to say to not let the comments about side effects wise you side effects wise. Although I can't say whether or not it prevents me from getting pregnant, I had little to no side effects! I think I was nauseous the first few days because I kept reading reviews when I shouldn’t have. But since then, I haven’t been nauseous. The bleeding withdrawal felt exactly like my period but I haven’t experienced any cramping yet. I’m in a long distance relationship, so there’s only a few weeks I’m sexually active. I’ve taken a pregnancy test before and recently and it’s come back negative for both, so it’s working so far!"
1,"p>		“I have been on Sprintec for 2 months now and I am taking it because of acne. At first I had a bit of insomnia and daytime sleepiness so then those were some disadvantages of course. My period was extremely long and I lost track of the length of it but it definitely lasted for about a month or even longer. I was super scared about weight gain but I didn’t gain anything at all! In fact, I’ve actually lost a couple pounds while on the pill. Everything turned out good for me with this pill besides sleep patterns and the long bleeding period but it definitely could’ve been worse! I recommend at least trying the pill to see how it works out for you and I do plan on continuing to take it for acne purposes. :)”</p"
1,"I've been on 
Sprintec for about 15 years now. I have mild endometriosis and PTLDS (post treated Lyme disease syndrome). My period used to last 15 days but since starting this in high school, they last about 5-7 days with 3 days of horrific cramping. Key note: You don't release an egg, However, you will still get ovulation cramps and aching especially if you have mild  to severe endometriosis. I'm dealing with this currently. It's still the best birth control for my situation. And the easiest to come off of when I decide to have children ( takes exactly 1 month to clear out of your system)."
0,"I do not recommend Sprintec at all!  I started Srintec to regulate my periods. However they got worse and bled so much more. My second month in I had 2 periods 9 days apart!! The one that came 9 days after was so bad that I bled over the floor just trying to get on the toilet. Along with terrible bleeding issues. I got dry skin, depression, extreme tiredness and fatigue. This was my first birth control I ever went on and I definitely won’t be using any other kind because this one scared me."
1,I’ve been taking Sprintec for almost a year due to me getting my IUD (Mirena) removed because the IUD caused me to grow facial hair and I’ve lost a considerable amount of hair on my scalp from the IUD as well. So far Sprintec has worked wonders! I did experience some nausea in the beginning but that goes away after a couple months. It also helped clear up my acne a lot too! You definitely feel some bloating but other than that I really have nothing bad to say about it.
1,"I have been on Sprintec for nearly 4 years and I have never had a problem. I was very worried about weight gain when I began this birth control but I never experienced that. My boobs do still become sore sometimes, but it’s not nearly as bad as it was before I got on Sprintec. It has been great knowing the day and even around the time of day I will start my period. My cramps are bad the first day of my cycle but that’s it. My gyno originally prescribed this specific birth control for acne but I have still experienced many break outs over the course of taking Sprintec. Yet for the past month, my skin has been the clearest it’s ever been. I don’t take it at the same time every day, but within the same hour (currently 2:30-3:30 AM lol). I have recently started wondering if Sprintec has affected my mental health during the 4 years I have been on it, but my gyno thinks it barely, if at all, has a negative effect. Sprintec is tried and true and I recommend it!"
0,"Hey guys. So I've used Nuvaring for the better part of three years. I decided to try it because the combo pill gave me horrible, awful nausea. I couldn't stand it. But I wanted to avoid pregnancy and avoid the awful, painful periods I've always had growing up. Nuvaring was a lifesaver. My painful, elongated periods became a thing of the past and I felt protected from an unwanted pregnancy. No major side effects to speak of, aside from some vaginal dryness. 

HOWEVER. I had a dental surgery last year and developed a superficial blood clot in my arm from the IV. It's apparently pretty rare. The ER tech called it ""bad luck."" Definitely birth control related, though. I'm 27, and I don't smoke. I am officially eligible for estrogen-based birth control and am switching to a POP this week. 
Overall, Nuvaring was pretty good for me as far as immediate side effects. But BE CAREFUL and make sure you inform your doctor you're on birth control if you're undergoing surgery."
0,"I am 26 years old and I was on NuvaRing for a month. Due to the added hormones, it made me feel like I was 18 again. I am a pretty happy person at age 26, but when I was a teenager I had anxiety issues that I think were hormone-related. After using NuvaRing, I became anxious and stressed and worried. Unfortunately, I also experienced other common side effects, including spotting (everyday), breast soreness, and bad cramping during the off week. For this reason, I did not renew after the first month. The only nice thing was that it's very good at birth control."
1,"I really wanted to try nuva, but unfortunately my body sucks. It's amazing very easy to use and pain free if you have no pelvic dysfunctions.I highly recommend it to healthy people, young people, and to anyone else I'd say just pay attention to your body but try it it's worth it. 

 I have hypertonic pelvic dysfunction so I  had to be put on bc (no choice). So I picked nuva ring, sounded better than taking another pill every day. Unfortunately it made the symptoms I was trying to combat worse. My doctor's ultimate deciding factor for taking me off of nuvaring was that I gained 21 pounds of water weight in just 5 days and it ended up giving me pulmonary edema. Luckily it was the only change in my life during that time and I took the ring out before the retention got any worse and now I'm fine. If you have a history of water retention DON'T TRY IT!"
1,"Took this to treat PMDD.
Took 6 months for my body to settle with this pill as I was suffering side effects and lots of irregular spotting. If you're at the beginning and you are frustrated, you might want to hold up for a couple of months to leave time for your body to get used to it.
For me it worked, I now only have light PMS for 2-3 days per month and barely any spotting or pill side effects. 
Good luck!"
1,"I started Yaz in January for acne as I discovered I had a huge hormonal imbalance and my skin was what took the hit. I started it along with Epiduo a month earlier. Epiduo has been helping a lot for the first 3 months as I was told I need at least 3 months for Yaz to slowly start working on my acne too. Now I finished month 4 on both and I am happy to say I have not had bad side effects from Yaz (I had purging, redness, flaking from Epiduo and still experience a bit of dryness but I found what products work for me to keep that under control). From Yaz I have had the positive effects of making my period non painful, making my scalp less oily and my hair more full as I experience less hair loss, my mood swings are wayyy under control and I don't cry before my period anymore, I am just still a bit angry at times before my period haha. Other than that I am still waiting to see how it will improve my skin more. I do believe it has helped a bit as I no longer get big cystic pimples."
1,"Yaz has worked really well for me ! I started taking it for cystic acne, and although it's not a magic/instant cure, after 5 months my skin is clearer than it's ever been :). It's the only thing that's ever actually helped my acne. The only downside is that it made me super depressed and nauseous for like a week when I started taking it Lol but after that it's been good."
0,"5 months ago I started my 13 year old on yaz for her facial and body acne prescribed by her primary care physician and a dermatologist.  We noticed the rapid weight gain on her and thought its cause she is home schooled due to the pandemic.  This is her 5th month on the pill and while its cleared her face its also given her terrible stretch marks on her buttocks, waist and the outer, front and insides of her legs. Absolutely horrible.  To take away her acne to gain her self confidence this was the price? For her to have stretch marks all over! Shes 4'11 and weighs 100lbs. My poor darling is more self conscious than ever before because this will stay with her for life. I wish i never would have listened to the doctors and just continue with the topical acne treatments, she is still on it but it just would have taken longer. Omg her little self esteem is crushed."
1,"Over the past 3 years, I have gone to dermatologists and an endocrinologist or acne. My dermatologist put me on Spirolactone, Azelaic Acid 15%, and Retin A Micro 0.5%, which did not help. I tried Face Reality, TCD, and even increased my Zinc intake. I then went to my endocrinologist, and he informed me that my testosterone was slightly elevated at 47.   I decided to go on the generic version of Yaz, and it literally changed my life. Within 5 days of taking the pill, the texture of my skin began to smooth out, I had not developed any acne for five days, my mood improved, and started having the energy to get back into the gym. There are some serious risks with Yaz, and a person must decide if they are willing to take on those risks, especially if you are in your 40s like myself. I kept track of anything weird that I felt or experienced and was very diligent with my breast checks. PLEASE read the warnings on this birth control before you try it. If the risk is worth it to you, go for it. Good luck."
0,"Instead of helping stop my period, it caused me to bleed heavily for 8 days, a few days after my period and made me feel very depressed and suicidal. Horrifying experience!"
0,"I never ever write user experiences but I HAD to with this one. I had a baby in March 2020 and went onto the pill July 2021 (writing this in March 2022) - I went onto the pill and loved that it basically got rid of my period, I hardly ever bled. But I was SEVERELY anxious, borderline depressed. I went to see a psychologist and a psychiatrist for the first time in my life (I am 28) and I was basically diagnosed with delayed post partum depression. I never went onto the antidepressants because my gut told me not to. I am now off the pill for a mere 8 days and I feel better than I have felt over the past 9 months. I cannot believe the impact the Yaz had on my mental health!!!"
1,"I have only been on Yaz for acne and birth control for 6 weeks but so far everything is all good! Period started as normal and was regular, still the same length but hopefully will get shorter and lighter with time. My acne has improved and pimples don’t appear to be as bad. No mood swings, no weight gain and no vomiting . I did have a bit of nausea the first few days but that’s generally me so not sure what that was from. 100% recommend, I'm so happy with it!"
1,Definitely helped with acne but had a lot of side effects. My acne got better but it did not go away. I also experienced more cramps and mood swings in comparison to my previous birth control pill.
0,I just finished my first month on Yaz and my acne is so so horrible :( before Yaz my acne was not even close to being this bad. Really discouraging as some people are commenting this is normal but some say it never got better for them.
0,"I started Yaz because I wanted to switch from my old birth control. My gynecologist suggested Yaz because of the less days off of hormones. I finished out my last pack of my old pill and switched to Yaz. About 2 days into it I had severe stomach cramping. I didn’t put two and two together, I missed work for 2 days and honestly thought I was constipated. The cramping continued once I returned to work, it was throughout the day and food seemed to subside it at times. It would really hurt in the middle of the night and in the mid-afternoon. I debated going to the hospital or doctor to figure out what was wrong.Fast forward through the whole pack, I got the the placebo pills. Within two days the stomach cramps were gone. I thought whatever was wrong was better. I took my first hormone pill on  Sunday, and Monday I had intense cramping again. 
Not everyone is the same, so it may work for you, just was not a good experience for me"
0,"I have been taking a generic Yaz for a little over three months. I was hoping after reading reviews that by this point things would be clearing up, but over these past three months, my acne has only gotten progressively worse. I am now at the point where I have at least three cystic pimples on my face at a time, and by the time those clear there are already news ones popping up."
0,"Everyone has different experiences, Yaz was not the pill for me. I was on it for 3 months, and while I was diligent about taking it and it did prevent pregnancy, the side effects I had to switch pills. My mood swings were AWFUL. One minute I’d be fine, and then I’d be biting someone’s head off for no reason and then I’d be sobbing for no reason. It also made my “period” symptoms worse. The cramping was bad! I had zero sex drive and my bleeding was heavier then I had experienced since middle school. It also did nothing to help with my acne, which I was really hoping it would. I am almost 26 and I’ve been on birth control since I was 14, but stopped for a year or 2 before I got into a serious relationship. This pill does not work for everyone."
0,"I decided to try YAZ after a bad experience with a different contraceptive pill when I was 18. I'm now 21 and have been on Yaz for 6 months with no luck. Whilst it cleared my acne well, the depression and anxiety that came with it has been unbearable. I have never suffered from any mental health issues in the past and it wasn't until reading these reviews about similar experiences that I realised I'm not crazy. I started having serious issues with my partner and I actually started blaming and resenting him, thinking he was the reason for my change in self confidence, happiness and overall mental wellbeing, I didn't even consider the pill until now. Not only that, but the anxiety has caused me to lose 5kg (making me quite under the healthy weight range) as I feel too sick in my stomach to have an appetite. I have also been continuously spotting for the last 4 out 6 months, contributing to my already low iron levels. Time to cease using YAZ."
1,"I was honestly terrified reading the reviews before talking to my Dr about Yaz but we came to the conclusion that this is the best possible option for me. I mainly got on Yaz for my PMDD and acne and have seen a significant improvement for both. My acne is practically nonexistent on my face now and I have very minor PMS symptoms. I saw many reviews saying weight gain can occur but I lost 20 lbs so far. I do have extreme cravings but have gotten pretty good at suppressing them and eating only in moderation. My breasts have grown probably a whole cup size and are extremely tender however. Despite that, Yaz was a great option for me and helped me significantly when antidepressants couldn’t."
1,"I've only taken it for a month so far, but I do notice a positive effect. My PMDD made me near suicidal, crying a lot, etc. to the point where I would just isolate myself from others to hide it. 
I didn't notice any of those problems this first month on this pill. I didn't even bloat or have oily skin like I used to. 
The first few days were weird, just adjusting to a new med. I got headaches for a couple of days. I've had consistently weird dreams and issues sleeping while on Yaz. I've had more of an appetite, but that may just be from going to the gym more recently. I didn't notice any real weight gain. 
If weird dreams is the price to pay for this drug, its worth it. My mental health definitely in my control now. I hope this drug continues working."
0,"I am three weeks into my pill pack, and for the past six days, I've cried every day, lashed out at my friends, and contemplated suicide. I've dealt with anxiety and depression in the past, but before starting it, I was in a very good spot mentally. I can't say for certain that this pill caused my psychotic break but I've never experienced something like this before. Thank you to all the women who have posted on this, sharing the same struggle. While the pill affects people differently, if you've struggled with mental issues in the past, I highly recommend looking for a different option."
0,"I’ve been taking Yaz a little over two years now, and it’s decent, but I honestly feel like it hasn’t done much for me. I started when I was 15, and my cycles are the same as they were before. My acne did clear up, but I also got older and stopped soccer, so I wasn’t sweating all summer, so there could’ve been that correlation too. There’s been no help with my mood or emotions and it’s starting making me very bloated, even though I’ve had the same exercise regime. I do think it’s made me more prone to anxiety and intrusive thoughts, but it hasn’t been debilitating. I think I’m going to look for other solutions, mostly because it isn’t really doing much for me besides making me a little unstable."
1,"I’ve been on Yaz for about 5 years now, loved it at the start, I have reasonably clear skin I skip my periods and don’t have spotting I don’t have any mental side effects however it has given me major gastrointestinal problems pretty much IBS when reading reviews and info make sure you find long term info other than that major issue it’s not to bad except the price $$$"
0,"AVOID this birth control. I know some people have had good experiences with this pill, but it’s not worth the gamble. I began this birth control in hopes it would help regulate my period and help manage some light acne. Within days, my face broke out worse than ever before. I took this pill for almost 3 months hoping it would improve but only worsened. Not only did I get horrible acne; my face and arms bloated, I couldn’t fall asleep at all, my anxiety and depression got so bad I became suicidal. I spend a week in the mental hospital and stopped taking the pill. Within days of stopping my symptoms began to go away. The acne took a long time to clear but no new breakouts happened after stopping the pill. Please don’t risk your mental health and body for this birth control. There are much better options"
1,"I don’t ever write reviews but I need to help some girl who is potentially going through the same situation as I was 4 months ago…! I was very on and off about whether or not I wanted to try Yaz as I had heard good reviews but then very horrific ones about blood clots that scared me so bad. I went to the doctors twice in one week as I was having the worst panic attacks due to me thinking I would get a clot, however I tried again and the first 2 months I was quite short tempered and very tired and my skin also got worse, however I persisted and the only negatives now 4 months in is that I do tend to get tired more often and sensitive to sad things, along with a lower libido, butttt the pill has completely gotten rid of my PMS and I feel so much more level headed and calm. I also don’t get severe sugar cravings like I used to and have actually lost some weight, my skin is clear and periods are pretty much gone in 3 days! (Also no pregnancy;)"
1,"I was a little nervous to start Yaz because I had a bad experience with Alesse years ago (it made my mood a lot worse). I started Yaz due to irregular periods and significant PMS symptoms. I take it with no breaks (no placebo pills) as per my Gynecologist and it has made a significant positive impact on my life. I had noticed that my mood is generally a lot stable during pregnancy and this is very similar since I do not ovulate. I'm happier, feel more even keeled and it has even increased my libido. I haven't noticed any side effects and my weight has been stable (I'm on the 3rd pack currently)."
0,"I had my fallopian tubes fully removed after Mirena for 11 years and deciding I didn't want more kids. My period was non existent for the time on Mirena so I only had my teenage years of periods to compare and suddenly as a 32 year old I was experiencing similar emotional/mental troubles as I had when I was a kid. Irrational thoughts, depression, anxiety, mood swings, crying constantly for no reason, hopelessness. I'd come out of this period fog and feel fine and be confused about why everything felt so dire just days before. My Dr started me on Yaz 2 months ago and my H cup breasts have gotten so big that none of my bras fit anymore (as if I needed them to be bigger?!) I have acne that won't clear, I've been bleeding in between periods along with uterine & vaginal pain, my sex drive is dead, hasn't made a difference in my PMDD. I called my Dr this morning and told her everything that's going on and she agreed this clearly isn't the right option for me and is switching me to Prozac."
0,"This pill sent my daughter into 18 months of a pure nightmare - of suicidality, depression, and overall psychotic behavior. 
Uncontrollable mood swings every single day. 

Doctors could never find a solution - until I finally found a professor in Australia doing the profoundly critical work on this pill. She has reams of data supporting others suffering from this pill. 

And we attended a stand up comedy night - and one comedian did a bit on how insane YAZ makes you - and the entire auditorium cheered in unison - hundreds of women- acknowledging this shared perspective. My daughter and I gasped with an A-HA moment. 

Within 5 weeks of coming off this pill - after 18 months taking it - my daughter was a totally different human being. She is now on Lolo. and things are great.

YAZ should be illegal."
1,"I have been taking Yaz for almost 10 months now and it has been the best pill I have ever been on. I am taking it for hormone replacement as well as acne issues.

During the first month of taking the pill, my skin went through a horrible purge which lasted about three weeks. After that was over, my skin began to improve daily. I rarely get breakouts now (occasionally a single pimple), my hair is so thick and healthy and my sleeping has improved immensely.

I have found my moods have been really stable whilst on this pill and have had zero issues with spotting.

I have lost about 12 kg since I commenced this pill and that was during lockdown and with minimal additional exercise. 

I highly recommend this pill if you need to regulate your hormones  and want to improve your skin, hair and lose some weight in the process!"
1,"Took this to treat PMDD.
Took 6 months for my body to settle with this pill as I was suffering side effects and lots of irregular spotting. If you're at the beginning and you are frustrated, you might want to hold up for a couple of months to leave time for your body to get used to it.
For me it worked, I now only have light PMS for 2-3 days per month and barely any spotting or pill side effects. 
Good luck!"
1,"I started Yaz in January for acne as I discovered I had a huge hormonal imbalance and my skin was what took the hit. I started it along with Epiduo a month earlier. Epiduo has been helping a lot for the first 3 months as I was told I need at least 3 months for Yaz to slowly start working on my acne too. Now I finished month 4 on both and I am happy to say I have not had bad side effects from Yaz (I had purging, redness, flaking from Epiduo and still experience a bit of dryness but I found what products work for me to keep that under control). From Yaz I have had the positive effects of making my period non painful, making my scalp less oily and my hair more full as I experience less hair loss, my mood swings are wayyy under control and I don't cry before my period anymore, I am just still a bit angry at times before my period haha. Other than that I am still waiting to see how it will improve my skin more. I do believe it has helped a bit as I no longer get big cystic pimples."
1,"Yaz has worked really well for me ! I started taking it for cystic acne, and although it's not a magic/instant cure, after 5 months my skin is clearer than it's ever been :). It's the only thing that's ever actually helped my acne. The only downside is that it made me super depressed and nauseous for like a week when I started taking it Lol but after that it's been good."
0,"5 months ago I started my 13 year old on yaz for her facial and body acne prescribed by her primary care physician and a dermatologist.  We noticed the rapid weight gain on her and thought its cause she is home schooled due to the pandemic.  This is her 5th month on the pill and while its cleared her face its also given her terrible stretch marks on her buttocks, waist and the outer, front and insides of her legs. Absolutely horrible.  To take away her acne to gain her self confidence this was the price? For her to have stretch marks all over! Shes 4'11 and weighs 100lbs. My poor darling is more self conscious than ever before because this will stay with her for life. I wish i never would have listened to the doctors and just continue with the topical acne treatments, she is still on it but it just would have taken longer. Omg her little self esteem is crushed."
1,"Over the past 3 years, I have gone to dermatologists and an endocrinologist or acne. My dermatologist put me on Spirolactone, Azelaic Acid 15%, and Retin A Micro 0.5%, which did not help. I tried Face Reality, TCD, and even increased my Zinc intake. I then went to my endocrinologist, and he informed me that my testosterone was slightly elevated at 47.   I decided to go on the generic version of Yaz, and it literally changed my life. Within 5 days of taking the pill, the texture of my skin began to smooth out, I had not developed any acne for five days, my mood improved, and started having the energy to get back into the gym. There are some serious risks with Yaz, and a person must decide if they are willing to take on those risks, especially if you are in your 40s like myself. I kept track of anything weird that I felt or experienced and was very diligent with my breast checks. PLEASE read the warnings on this birth control before you try it. If the risk is worth it to you, go for it. Good luck."

1,"I've always had bad anxiety about new medications and scared myself quite a bit reading reviews when I first started taking this for PCOS. Luckily the only main symptoms of PCOS I had before were irregular bleeding/spotting and some acne. The first month wasn't horrible but wasn't great, my period lasted almost 2 weeks , I had some breast tenderness and some bad (but manageable cramping). However, after taking it for about 5 months now I can say it has dramatically improved my situation. I was nervous about gaining weight but I am a fit healthy person who works out so I actually ended up losing a few lbs. The best thing is that for the first time in my life I have a regular period, with minimal cramping and lighter flow. The only negatives are that if you don't take it at the same time or skip a pill you will immediately get breakthrough bleeding that can last for quite some time, and also my depression/anxiety has gotten a bit worse although I can't say for sure the Yaz has caused it."
1,"This is my first time writing a review because I OBSESSIVELY read all the reviews for Yaz while going through the ""just starting it time."" Tl;dr, my acne is better than it has ever been in my life. I'm on month five, but pack sixish (I tried skipping my period, didn't work for me). Nothing's ever worked for my cystic acne--I've tried everything except accutane. Yaz was my last resort before going onto the accutane. I was concerned because I was on a different birth control (Maxim) that was apparently also anti-androgen, but it didn't help. I do want to warn you, as many other commenters reported: my acne was THE WORST IT HAS EVER BEEN in the first 3 and a half months or so. Like, so bad I didn't want to leave the house, so bad I woke up before my boyfriend to put on make up and waited to wash my face until after he was asleep (spoiler alert: he couldn't care less. haha. but I did.) I'm left with some scarring and hyperpigmentation that's slowly going away. I'm feeling optimistic :)"
1.0,"Honestly great experience. The first month was awful, mood swings, horrible attitude, but after my body got used to it I loved it. My emotions are regulated. I gained weight but in the right places, periods are lighter and less days. I originally got on it to clear my acne and it has done a great job. Overall I think it has improved my life."
0.0,"I am a nurse and went into starting this by reminding myself that any new med can cause side effects—nothing prepared me for this. I took Junel for 3 months and stopped taking it yesterday. During my first month I noticed: extreme nausea, acne, irritability, mood swings, a sense of doom that is hard for me to explain which grew worse day after day. I live with anxiety which has always stemmed from life events (a move, new job, test, etc) but the feeling of dread that I have had for the past 3 months is crippling and is over nothing. I had several episodes of complete dissociation which has triggered my anxiety to the point that I’m reconnecting with my therapist. Uncontrollable crying/sobbing, paranoia, I feel like everyone is mad at me constantly. I started this because of a new relationship. Fortunately my bf is patient and understanding but I have lost myself completely after starting this BC. I truly feel hopeless and like a shell of myself.  Wouldn’t wish this on anyone."
0.0,"I was given two different generics of this and the first couple of months were not bad but last week I felt like I was crying and sad for no reason ( I suffer from anxiety and occasional depression) but this time I felt out of control.

Honestly if you struggle with your mental health I don't really recommend but every body is different so I can only speak for myself and my experience."

During the first and second month of being on this pill I had begun feeling depressed, which sucked as I hadn’t dealt with that before. I also had break through bleeding for a bit which was super annoying. But I decided to stick it out, knowing my body was just slowly getting used to the new pill. It has now been about 4 or 5 months on Junel, and I honestly want to go cold turkey right now. I’ve had intrusive thoughts constantly, depression, anger, and no sex drive. The only pros of Junel are that my period is only 3 days long, and I only have cramps on the first day. Plus I haven’t gotten pregnant. I’m hoping to find a better source of (non-horomonal) contraceptive soon!"
1.0,"I actually really love Junel. I have tried everything from Yaz to Lo Loestrin to Apri and this has been the ONLY birth control my body is fine on. Yeah there was a brief month where my mental health was rough, but that wasn’t from the birth control itself (turns out thyroid conditions and PCOS can be a beast until they are figured out). This was the first one I ever tried and any time it’s been changed I start dreaming of when I can go back on this one. If you do have issues from it or any birth control, it probably is from another hormonal issue so don’t write it off completely."
1.0,"I absolutely love this birth control. I have had zero issues whatsoever. I take mine continuously and skip placebo pills. No side effects, no mood swings, nothing. Highly recommend!"
0.0,"I will start by saying I know everyone’s body is different, and may not work for me, might work great for you! However, I’ve tried tons of BC pills this birth control is definitely not for me, and has the worst side effects that I personally have experienced! I started experiencing anxiety, which I’ve rarely had issues with in the past. I also have been slightly nauseous, but I mostly notice myself dry gagging…often.. so bizzare! I also have been having more headaches and stomach aches than usual. Especially when I first started taking this pill, lots of headaches. I also experienced horrible night sweats, which have started to go away after a few months. I also spot a light brownish blood, nearly everyday, even after a full period. Sex drive definitely decreased, but not horribly bad. That is just my experience from June Fe pill."

0.0,"First birth control I ever tried and I went on it because I was in a long term sexually active relationship. No bad side effects EXCEPT I had 0 sex drive, it completely changed my relationship for the worse. Switching to find something else that will hopefully increase my sex drive"
1.0,"I’d just like to weigh in to these comments and say that I’m shocked at all these comments saying it made them crazy and moody, this pill FIXED my anxiety and craziness"
0.0,"Please do not take this and if you are experiencing new anxiety or depression stop taking this!  I have taken Larin Fe with no issues for over 2 years.  Recently my pharmacy switched wholesalers and can no longer get Larin Fe so they gave me Junel Fe.  I have been taking this medication for 6 weeks and it finally hit me today what has made the last 6 weeks so miserable, Junel.  I went from being a happy, easy-going person to a miserable, moody, depressed, crying for no reason, anxious and withdrawn individual.  I have had chronic headaches.  Awful menstrual cramps, breast pain, bloating and generalized pain in my abdomen. It has been awful.  I did some self reflection to try to determine what was happening to me and it hit me, this all started when I began taking Junel Fe.  I reached out to my pharmacy and was told ""you are not alone, we here this a lot with this medication"".  Why is this still on the market.  I would not wish this on anyone."
1.0,"I'm 31 years old and have suffered from hormonal acne since high school. I have tried every cream/treatment out there and nothing seemed to work. I went to a new ob/gyn who took the time to do a hormone test and found out I had low progesterone levels. After using Junel for ONLY about a month, my skin has never looked better, so I have continued to take them (I started in September 2021). Even during that ""time of the month"" when I usually have annoying chin breakouts, those are nonexistent! I know that everyone is different and medication has different side effects, but this has truly been a miracle for me. I highly recommend giving this a try, I'm glad that I did!"
1.0,"p>		“I responded well to the higher progesterone/lower estrogen combination. I only took it for a couple weeks because I don’t want to commit to artificial hormones, but it helped with the headaches and anxiety that I would get in the second half of my cycle. Since I know my body likes the “progesterone”, I’m going to try some more natural alternatives and see if that helps in case I’d ever want to get pregnant in the future”</p"
0.0,"I can not stop crying, feel very moody and I feel extremely nauseous. I only have been on it for 5 days. The worse I felt in my life!"
1.0,"Only had minimal side effects the first few months taking it. Now I don’t have any noticeable side effects and I skip my periods every month with it, which is fantastic! Personally, I don’t get all the bad reviews. I absolutely love it. Going strong for a year and a half now!"
1.0,I wanted to leave a review to hopefully help some people as I feel people are more inclined to review when they have had a really good or especially when they have a really bad experience. The first month or so I was really depressed but that subsided by month 3. However I ended up gaining 10 pounds on this pill and the weight is almost impossible to lose except for on the reminder pill week. Other than that by month 3 I felt like myself.
1,"Please relax it works if you took it within the time frame My story is that I had sex with a man, it was just a hookup so I really couldn’t get pregnant. Anyway the condom broke and he came 100% inside of me. I am not in BC either. And I was about 4 days after my last period had ended. I took the plan B 1 hour later that day, had brown spotting 4 day after taking the pill light and lasted 4 days, And I had to wait for my period to come 2 weeks from then. Finally 10 days late my period finally came. You will be okay and stressing is only gonna delay your period more. Breath you’re fine!"
1,I just want to say I am so freaking grateful to all of you for sharing. The official pages will talk about mild cramps for the first few days it’s been it’s been over a week for me I’m technically supposed to start my period in a couple of days but I’m less worried about it being late now because of all of you. This has been such a horrible experience so thank you all very much for taking the time to write your review
1,"Okay so I’m sharing my experience. I was having sex on Sunday 02/27 at around 2am and I made my partner take the used condom off and put on a clean condom. Unfortunately, there was too much friction and the second condom broke. I started to worry bc I knew that my ovulation day was close. I checked my period tracker and my ovulation day was supposed to be that Monday 2/28 but I was cramping all weekend. I went to CVS and bought a  Plan B at around 6am that Sunday and took it about 7 after showering and cleaning myself thoroughly. I was convinced that I had started ovulating earlier than usual and the next two weeks were terrible! I got every side effect symptom from Plan B and I was convinced I was pregnant! I started spotting on Friday March 11th and I swore it was implantation bleeding, then I got a huge clot the next day and my period had been super heavy for two days. It’s a little normal now but trust, Plan B works as long as it’s before ovulation!"
1,"Me and my boyfriend had an accident and I was ovulating literally on my high days or what not , I was scared it wouldn’t work. I stressed myself out  so bad. I took the Plan B within 24 hrs and when I tell you the symptoms I was experiencing you would think I was pregnant ,I was madly tired literally would sleep the whole day, had no energy what so ever, I also had a huge appetite one min I’m microwaving a meal the next I’m making noodles for myself ."
1,"I had to write this review as soon as I was able share my whole experience. First off, my anxiety was through the roof. Just like you I was googling everything imaginable. I was scared, I already had an ectopic pregnancy before and I didn’t want to be pregnant again, well not now. I was in my fertile window (2 days before ovulation) when the condom broke. I took the plan b like an hour after the incident. I prayed every night that this pill would be effective because I weigh well over 160lbs more on the heavier side & they said studies show it doesn’t work at all but I guess it worked for me. I will say I didn't have really bad side effects just headaches and nausea. My period came 3 days early than it was supposed to, heavier than usual but just glad it came and I'm not pregnant. I know it’s harder said than done but try to not freak yourself out searching on google, it makes the symptoms even worse and it feel like you are pregnant for sure. The sooner you take the pill the better."
1,"I told myself that once I got my period, I’d come back and put my experience under this discussion or forum. I had unprotected sex on 2/1/2022 & according to my Flo app at the time, I was either ovulating or already did so. Either way, I feared that the egg had already been released & fertilized in the span of the two days I couldn’t get to the Plan B quick enough (I was four hours away from home). Reading all those stories online about how it’s basically ineffective during/after ovulation, made me scared, but I just kept coming back to these posts to calm me down especially when my body began to change. My discharge began to turn pink & brown & I feared that I was experiencing implantation bleeding, but that was just the Plan B doing what it does to majority of women’s cycles, changing it. I took Vitamin C pills to bring my period on days later & it worked as well, so I’m not 100% sure if the Plan B worked alone, but I do know I still got my period with a Plan B & C."
1,"Worked when I had already ovulated ! I had medium bleeding for 3 days a week after taking it. My period was 17 days late but definitely came, take pregnancy tests if you're worried after being late. Stress makes your period come later so relax and remember you have options"
0,"Oh wow. The side effects of this medication are not worth it. I had been on it years before so I tried it again to help with acne. I became so fatigued and lethargic I could barely walk my dog or go up steps without a lot of effort. My boyfriend was extremely worried about me, saying it was the darkest I’ve ever been. I became depressed, overwhelmed, nauseous, upset stomach daily, hopeless, tearful, and had panic symptoms as well. No acne would be great but I’m about to ruin my life if I stay on this any longer!! Only took 12 days worth but I have to stop."
1,"I’ve been on many different brands in the past 5 years, and thankfully my boyfriend has stood around to experience my different personalities lol. I recently switched to Tri Sprintec because I dealt with depression, panic attacks and anxiety on the other brands. I also struggled with weight gain. I’ve been on Tri Sprintec for about 2 months now, the first week I  felt nauseous and cramped, it subsided and then I had a little spotting for about 2 weeks. My boyfriend has told me my acne cleared so much and my anger and mood changed positively. He understands that usually its the medication that would have triggered things. I also haven’t been having an appetite which is good in my opinion, on other birth controls I would binge eat soo much and never stop eating. I gained like 70 pounds in the last 2 year but now I barely crave."
0,"worsened my acne to the point where I couldn’t even look at myself! i was on it for two months, yet some people get a “breakthrough breakout” but for me, it was unbearable! I broke out in places i never had broken out before! The wait was not worth my mental health!"
0,"This birth control turned me into a whole other person! It gave me such bad anxiety, I cried at everything so easily, and always felt so unstable. I was an emotional roller coaster. I think it’s because it has a different level of hormone each week so your body can’t really adjust. It also made my acne worse. The one plus side was it made my boobs grow a cup size and they looked more perky"
0,"BEWARE, and know what may be coming if you use this long-term. I started in high school and remained on this pill for five years, and after the initial first three months of nightmarish life (crying all the time, moody, suicidal), this pill worked beautifully for me. I had no acne, I never got pregnant (although I was having unprotected sex), I had no lowered sex drive, and I could function perfectly. Little to no negative side effects after the initial horrible ones.
However, five years later when I stopped taking this pill I had a complete mental breakdown. Any semblance of stability and respect I had for myself for gone, and I was no longer a rational person. It was very scary and I truthfully feel like this pill made it so I was not myself after a while."
1,"I've been on lolo for about 3 months now (starting my fourth pack) and so far I've had mixed emotions about it. I suffered a LOT with heavy periods and horrible cramping, and my periods would last over a week and be extremely heavy. Given that I am anemic and the pain was unbearable, I decided to try out birth control as a form of contraceptive and for my periods. 
overall, my periods have been so light and only for 4 days (when I take the sugar pills). Right from starting it I never had bleeding or spotting in between which was great. I had mild cramping during the first two periods but nothing that an advil couldn't fix.I have however broken out a LOT. I always struggled with acne (part of the reason I chose to start (BC) birth control) however I have had some really gross breakouts recently. I know I'm still starting it out so I am hoping it will clear up soon but this is a side effect of this pill so keep that in mind if that is your main reason for starting bc!!"
0.0,"I've had Liletta for nine months now. The first five went smoothly, no periods and barely any cramps. 
The lack of bleeding is the only pro. The last four months however I’ve experienced what doctors call crotch lightning, and only usually happens when pregnant. It feels like someone took a nine volt battery to the IUD, I get electric shock feelings almost everyday for long periods of time. we experimented w other bc options to combat it but i ended up getting it pulled, because the sensation was crippling. I'm also mad depressed. 
Do not recommend."
0.0,"So it's effective in terms of me not being pregnant, but I really don't like anything else about it. Constant cramping (4 years in), the insertion was SO painful, and I am more depressed and anxious than I've ever been. I'm getting it removed next week because I've had enough, and I'm going back to the pill."
0.0,"I had gotten Liletta November 2020, insertion was bearable, I say a 5/10 on the pain scale. Within an hour I started feeling extremely light headed, and had almost a labor type contraction feeling of cramps, It hurt to stand, it hurt to sit. I felt better later that evening, but felt a little nauseous for about 2-3 days. I bled for about a month, sometimes light bleeding, sometimes super heavy. My periods were regular, and painless, but kind of long. I started to see my weight rise, but not too much.  About 10 months later, I started getting TWO periods a month, both 9 days long. My weight continued to rise slowly. Now, February 2022, I’m 45 pounds heavier, I’m completely and utterly depressed, and I get 3 periods a month, each one 2-3 days in between to not bleed. Honestly this was the worst decision I could have made for myself, and will be getting it removed."
0.0,"The liletta perforated through my uterus within 6 months. I had to have surgery to get it removed, 3k+ dollars and extreme pain. Luckily it was just wedged between my ovary and uterus because a concern was is could puncture an organ or bowel."
0.0,"I had Liletta put in immediately after having Mirena removed (literally within a few minutes). I had thought I was getting Mirena replaced with Mirena, but they didn't tell me until it was already out that they didn't carry Mirena at Planned Parenthood where I live. This was January of 2021. It is now February of 2022 and I have gained more than 40 pounds despite working on my eating and work out habits. On Mirena, I never had a period (for 6 years!) and now I spot monthly. It's been progressively getting worse. I never dealt with cramps on Mirena, but now I feel that awful pain. I began really noticing changes 4-6 months in regarding my moods. I thought it was just stress and tried to put it off, but I'm not having crazy mood swings. I'll be angry and emotional out of nowhere. I feel bad for the people in my life because this is not me and I am not like this. It never occurred to me that it could be from my birth control, but now I now better."
0.0,I got the liletta put in yesterday at 3:30pm. The insertion and for the rest of the afternoon was painful due to cramping. I have been breastfeeding my baby since he was born. It is 5:00am and I am having to pump. I thought the liletta would hurt my milk supply but so far I am still pumping the same amount. I don't have any cramping this morning. But I have only had the liletta in for 1 day.
0.0,"I swapped my mirena IUD for Liletta, because that’s all my obgyn offered. I was told the two are the same. I was frustrated that I was not informed I would be given a different IUD until I was sitting on the chair for my procedure. Like many others here, the pro has been that I haven’t gotten pregnant, but I’m experiencing weight gain, face acne and sensitive skin on face (face wash products I’ve always used now burn and irritate my skin) and I’ve got painful cramps days before my period and longer periods. I might take it out, especially seeing these reviews. I miss my Mirena. Also, my libido is ridiculously low. No clue if it’s all related to Liletta or what, but these are definitely changes."
0.0,"I had Liletta for 15 weeks. Insertion and removal were quick and painless. It did decrease my bleeding. Had it removed for increasing, severe anxiety."
0.0,"Had Mirena 5 years then another one 7 years with no problems whatsoever! No periods, no weight gain, actually lost weight, had energy. Went in for another replacement and was told them switched to liletta but it was same. Definitely nowhere near same for me!! Weight gain 25+ in year, severe migraines, reflux, acne, no energy, abdominal cramps, back pain, high blood pressure Not to mention so much more painful on insertion than previous 2!....just had removed this week. Anything is better than Liletta!"
1.0,"I had this put in 7 weeks ago. I’m 51 and using it for peri menopause. I’m feeling much better, but the first month was an absolute nightmare. I bled 75% of the time, had terrible cramps, suicidal ideation and acne so bad I felt 15 again. I’m waiting to see how this pans out. Benzoyl peroxide is working for the acne, I’m no longer crampy or suicidal, but I’m often tired and foggy and wonder if the IUD has my immune system ramped up  which doesn't feel healthy. And sometimes I feel like Wonder Woman. I should have read more about this instead of just taking my doctor’s word that it would fix everything. Maybe it still will, but I wish I’d been better prepared for that first month."
1,"Very glad I found this pill! I had been struggling with hormonal cystic acne on my chin ever since being a teenager (now 22), it was minor but affected my confidence and would make it painful to smile. Also it was never fun waiting for it to inevitably come around every month. Eating healthy, expensive skincare and cutting out sugar helped but didn't stop it. I thought it was something I'd have live with for the rest of my life until this pill. 

I'm now 3 months in  on Yasmin and my skin has never looked clearer or felt cleaner. I was worried from reading the reviews that it might get worse for people with minor acne but my skin is glowing! Also I have experienced no mood effects or weight gain either.

For honesty, one drawback however is that the pill has caused a tiny cervical ectopy which means that I have experienced bleeding after sex. however this hasn't been painful and the doctor has informed me it should go away. However, Yasmin has been 10/10 besides that."
0,"I have taken Yasmin for about 18 months I was on dianette which kept my skin clear for years. Since moving over to Yasmin my skin went downhill pretty quickly. I can’t say if it’s helping or making it worse as I don’t know what my skin would have been like had I not taken anything after coming off Dianette. But it certainly hasn’t done anything to clear it, my skin gets worse by the day"
0,"Ok yes, birth control will prevent you from having an unwanted pregnancy. But that really is the only benefit, take the pros with the cons when deciding to start birth control pills. You will get acne. You will be so moody all the time and have uncontrollable emotional outbursts. Your confidence will shatter because the hormones make you feel less feminine and more masculine. You will be bloated and hungry all the time. You won't have a sex drive and your vagina will always be dry. You never ovulate so your literally depriving your body of the natural womanly duties. Boobs will hurt all the time. You're at risk of causing blood clots. The list goes on. since stopping birth control, I have been able to regulate my moods, feel more feminine and have chosen natural planning instead. Meaning I track my own body and it's cycles, avoid sex during peak times, and always use condoms and Plan V as a last resort. Your body will thank you for it, trust me."
0,"I started taking Ysmin 3 months after I had my baby. I've gained weight, feel low/anxious from time to time, leg pain, random hot flushes, very angry over nothing (I've never been an angry person) and just feel all over a bit rubbish with my relationships. My baby will be a year old next month and today is my last day taking this pill. It never clicked with me that this is causing my low mood etc."
1,"I’ve been on Yasmin for 8 months.
My periods are regular now and almost painless ( major improvement ). My anxiety I think has been damped but my overall mood is a fraction lower that before ( I’m ok with this though because is stable I don’t get mood swings around period anymore). My skin is MUCH more stable - had painful acne before now just get one or two spots around my period.
I have noticed my hair getting thinner in the past year or so and I’m wondering if this could be related after reading other reviews but I have also had a lot of work stress.
I’m thinking of coming off the pill however as the biggest side affect currently is my low sex drive (used to be very high) which defeats the purpose of birth control for me as I am using it to have safer sex. Not looking forward to my old periods back though. 
From personal experience if you already have a low sex drive or don’t mind changing yours then this pill have been great"
0,"At first, I didn't really think birth control was controlling my life. I started using birth control eight years ago after giving birth to my daughter. I started with NuvaRing. I really didn't think how I was feeling was due to the birth control at first. After five years I removed the NuvaRing and started Yasmin. As I sit here and type this I regret it. I am DEPRESSED more than I have ever been in my entire life. It's like I can't find any joy or happiness in anything. All I want to do is just stay in bed. I have no sex drive. I can go weeks/months without sex. I don't even think about sex, I don't get aroused, NOTHING!!!! Sex drive is just gone! I have headaches, mood swings, and probably other things that is caused by this medicine. I have been watching a lot of documentaries on birth control and all of the awful things is does to a our body. Since I have three children I've decided to get a tubal ligation. I pray to feel whole again."
0,"I had been on many different pills and only started Yasmin pill and was a fit and healthy 38 year old.  Within 4 months l started experiencing shortness of breath and back pain only to be told it was anxiety and a back issues. Six months later l was diagnosed after demanding a CTR on my lungs l had multiple blood clots in my lungs!!! 
Please if you experience and shortness of breath seek medical attention straight away."
1,"I have been taking Yasmin for years. I primarily use it for my skin but also birth control (I’d use another pill if it was just for birth control due to the risks associated with it). Having tried many pills, this has been the best for my skin which I would say is virtually completely clear, I would have acne otherwise (and I’m in my 30s). I haven’t got pregnant yet either so the birth control element is good. I do get headaches with it, but I do with other pills too, and I can’t say with certainty that if I came off the pill that would stop the headaches. My mood seems fine on it, I haven’t noticed any changes and I don’t suffer from depression. I do get a bit of light spotting in between periods but I have had this investigated and nothing concerning has been found. I may have put a bit of weight on with this pill but nothing dramatic and again it’s hard to say if the pill is responsible (the older you get the more your metabolism slows down). I can’t complain so far."
1,"When I started I didn’t feel any side effects, I expected tender breasts, I had no weight gain, no mood swings, even three months in and my skin started to clear up."
1,"Took it for about 4 years, before I had the Diane for some years which is similar. Now I’m off it for also 2 years, using a copper IUD. Looking back, the Diane had me more depressed. The Yasmin gave me amazing spotless and vital skin, bigger boobs, nice smooth shiny hair, less peach fuzz on the rest of my body, stable mood, easy periods. The whole last year with the copper IUD has been horrible. In the 2 years without the pill my boobs shrunk incredibly, my sex drive is less, hair is very hard to manage and has a different structure, my skin has a lot of acne and wrinkles and the peach fuzz got a lot worse again. Really considering getting back on the Yasmin."
0,I was on roaccutane for 6 months and finished my course almost a year ago. I started noticing I was breaking out a lot more than usual and it really affected my mood. I was also getting irregular periods so of course my doctor recommended that I went on the pill. I’ve been taking the Yasmin pill for exactly a week now and my skin hasn’t been this bad in ages. I’m feeling extremely low all the time and my confidence has been shattered. My sister is on the same pill and it works for her so I’m hoping to see an improvement sooner rather than later.
0,"I have been on this pill for 2 years. The first year and a half was good. Lost weight, cleared acne etc. However, now I am severely tired all the time, my periods are still 7 days long, I have extreme anxiety which is causing relationship breakdowns and constantly crying. I don recommend this pill."
0,"I used this horrible pill for 10 years. It caused me to have horrible mood swings, rage outbursts, changed personality and suicidal thoughts. Last year after having harmed myself I thought I'd quit the pill and turns out the self harm and horrible angry jealous anxious thoughts went away. I'm still a nervous wreck though. I felt like I had no control over my emotions, I was scared I would harm myself, my pets or loved ones. Stay away from this pill, please. Especially if you already suffer from anxiety and depression. Don't wait for the symptoms to go away."
1,I have been on Yasmin for over 15 years. I have never had any issues other than switching from the Name Brand to the generic. This pill never gave breakouts or adverse reactions. My only issue is that my insurance company refused to cover the cost since it is the Name Brand. I have tried the generic and it is not the same. It produced greater PMS symptoms and also gave me hormonal acne. I am now 33 and considering going off the pill altogether in fear of starting something new. Has anyone else stopped Yasmin? If so could you please share your experience? I am a bit nervous - (not about having a baby) but any side effects from stopping the hormone??
1,It didn’t cause depression for me. I lost weight and my boobs got bigger. It’s easy to use
1,"I’m in love with this pill! I’ve just started the second pack and my skin hasn’t been this clear in well over a year. I regret so much trying to clear my skin naturally when this worked so effectively and quickly. Side effects were breast tenderness which has gone away now and resulted in larger breasts. Headaches, I didn’t used to get headaches but on the pill free week I had them quite bad and needed to take paracetamol. During the pill days I have mild headaches almost daily that don’t last long and don’t require medication but this is a side effect I’m willing to live with as acne DESTROYED my confidence. I also hope this side effect will go away after a few cycles and also if you take it exactly the same time everyday as the headache is caused by oestrogen withdrawal. Haven’t noticed any weight gain. I previously had very light periods but now I have heavier and longer periods. I didn’t break out at all!"
0,"I used the generic version for birth control and to control my cystic acne, which had started a few months prior at age 21. The first few months using the pill I didn't notice many mood-related side effects, but experienced pretty severe acne. After about 6 months, my skin had cleared up, but I began experiencing a lot of anxiety and became depressed. I also lost weight around this time, but I'm not sure if this was a direct impact of the pill, or a result of the fact that I started working out like crazy to counteract the anxiety I was experiencing. I had started to break out again (cystic acne mainly around my temples and sides of my face), and my mental health (and sex drive!) had just tanked.This persisted until I decided to stop taking the pill after about 10 and a half months of usage;  I stopped taking the pill March 2021 and since then my mood has improved significantly, my sex drive has improved and my skin has also improved with improvements to my diet and skin care routine."
1,"I started Yasmin a year ago after at age 30 my skin went crazy and I erupted with cystic acne all over my chin and jaw line. I had always had spotty skin through my twenties but this was next level. My forehead would be super greasy by 9 in the morning too. I started on Yasmin and it took about 3 months to kick in but once it did it was amazing. The pimples stopped and I could go most of the day without having to powder my makeup. One year on and I am a few months into Australian humid summer while having to wear face masks, and have not had a single pimple. I have had no nasty side effects other than nausea the first 2 weeks of starting on it. Periods are so light as well."
1,"I took Yasmin for almost 20 years, from age 18 years old to 37 years old. I never experienced ANY unwanted side effects. My period came every month like clockwork, I could literally time it to the clock. My periods were 5 days (only Monday thru Friday) and light. I never once experienced any spotting or breakthrough bleeding. I scheduled my life around its perfect predictability. I can count on one hand the number of times I missed a dose. I’ve recently had to stop taking Yasmin for my age and other risks for VTE. I miss it dearly and am at a loss about what to transition to because all other non-estrogen methods do not regulate cycles and are not predictable like Yasmin."
1,"I started talking this pill 1.5 month ago for PMDD. I still have PMS to some degree but my mood is SO MUCH BETTER! I was really sceptic to take this at first because of all the negative experiences I read, but I gave it a try anyway.. I feel like I am myself again. I feel happier, am less anxious (which was severe), I can handle stressful situations better. My sex drive has gone up because I’m not always in pain or depressed anymore. I still need to take it longer to notice full effects, but the ones I’ve already noticed are life changing for me. I am so much more confident about myself. I don’t feel “puffy” anymore. No more swollen stomach. My acne is not gone (yet) but is a LOT better than it used to be. My wounds heal better. My skin looks more moisturised and clear. I have more energy,… the only downside is that I’m very tired in the morning. I will come back for update after 3 months of taking it"
0,"I would not recommend Yasmin. After being on Sprintec for years and trying Nexplanon. I was put on Yasmin to help with my moderate acne. I started it in Nov 2020. Within maybe 2 months, I saw an improvement in my acne, which was great. Over time, my mental health went absolutely downhill. I found myself crying constantly over everything. I became depressed, VERY anxious, and did not want to spend time with anyone. I would lock myself away in my room in bed. I began doubting all my relationships and questioning everything around me (ie. what was the point of life). It took me months to realize it may be Yasmin. I stopped taking Yasmin at the beginning of June 2021. About two weeks after stopping Yasmin I was feeling a lot more like my old self. If anyone has had their mental health dramatically plummet while taking Yasmin, you are not crazy. Yasmin can absolutely wreak havoc on your emotional well being. Please talk to you doctor about other options. I now have an IUD that I love."
0,"I had taken this pill for PCOS for 6 months and that was probably the worst time of my life when I suffered from severe anxiety and depression. While I lost 6 kgs weight and had clear skin, on the other hand I lost my sleep and sanity! The most difficult phase was my mental condition after I stopped taking the pill that I had to seek medical help to get out of that condition! It is strongly advised not to take this pill especially if you are already suffering from any kind of mental health issue."
0,"I gave this birth control a chance after coming off of a non hormonal birth control that didn't control my periods. There was absolutely nothing good about this pill. I gave it seven months. My acne has permanently disfigured my jaw line, large patches of cysts, new ones daily. They are inflamed and painful. Nothing helps, more kept coming. My period never came on time, and would still be 9 days, controllable but still too much for being on BC. My moods were out of control. Constant suicidal thoughts. I've never dealt with such bad constant intrusive thoughts in my life. They need to take this pill off the market. It is literally dangerous. Three days off, my emotions are controlled, and I haven't had a cystic acne in 3 days!"
1,I am 19 and have been on Aviane and it’s other generic Vienva since August 2021. I would say it did not affect my acne or weight much. I did gain some weight but I workout a lot so probably muscle. It took away some period pain and I didn’t get pregnant. Although it did severely increase my anxiety and depression. Might be switching.
1,"I switched from Larissia to Aviane in December due to insurance coverage and let me tell you - the difference is unreal. My mother, not knowing I switched birth controls asked me, ""Did you switch pills? You seem so much better mentally."" And it is true. Larissia had me feeling constantly bloated, crying daily before leaving my bed, some days I could barely leave my bed. When I went out with my friends, the night always ended in tears. Being on Aviane has totally changed my life. I feel happy and normal, like my old self is back again. I did not want to blame birth control for my change in mood/mental wellness but this change really had a positive impact on me. I know birth control is a game of trial and error and everyone is different, but if you are currently struggling because of your birth control, take the time to switch. It is worth it."
0,"Unfortunately this specific birth control was not a good fit for me. I had been on BC pills in the past and have never had an experience as bad as this one. I had only been taking it for a few days, every time I would wake up with intense waves of nausea that would last all day. I was violently throwing up, shaking, chills, fatigued, sweating profusely. As soon as I stopped my prescription I immediately felt so much better. I was prescribed this bc from an online website called NURX. I  recommend going into your OB office for a more personal experience with someone who knows your body as well as you do :)"
0,"I was prescribed Aviane and tried it for the first time for about a year. My mood changes crept up on me and before I knew it, I wasn't me and had lost every desire to live! I felt depressed and always full of loathing. So full of just plain loathing for everything, for absolutely no reason. I was plain and simply put, not in the mood for life anymore! After changing to an IUD, I waited over 6 months to see if my mood and depression changed. And it did! I am me again and not depressed! 
Also, this pill caused me to for the 1st time in my life, to have a sun moustache! Google it.. Darkening of skin can be an actual side effect with this one! 
My period got incredibly light and short, more like light spotting at most! I didn't mind that so much but it did have me worried about being pregnant at times. I had clear skin while on it but got the absolute worst post pill acne I'v ever gotten after stopping any pill! 
I didn't get pregnant, so that's a plus! Overall not happy, wouldn't recommend"
0,"So I have been on this pill for almost a month and when I tell you it has been a nightmare. I have been having the craziest mood swings I have ever experienced in my life, so I'm going to get off this pill because I don't want to lose my relationship or job. This pill can work for people but unfortunately it just doesn't work well for me"
0,"After having a baby a nurse practitioner prescribed this to me & I am on day 15 of my period. I called and she told me to continue taking it and that my body is just getting used to it. Well, there’s no sign of my period ending so I stopped taking it and now I’m bleeding even more!! Not trying to gross anyone out but it’s dark black and seems as if it’s never going to end! This pill is the worst but I know everyone’s body will not react the same. It’s awful and on top of all that I’m anemic so this is no good for me."
1,"I have had a great experience with this medication so far. I started Aviane ( Levonorgestrel/Ethinyl Estradiol 0.1mg/0.02mg)  a little over a month ago. I was prescribed by a telehealth care provider and was initially very skeptical because of all of the negative reviews here but so far so good ! I did get bloated the first 2-3 weeks and gained like 4 lbs in water weight but I  drank lots of water and ate clean and exercised regularly now I am at my normal weight again.   The first week I started , I did get some headaches but nothing too bad.  During the placebo week , I decided to skip the placebo pills and move on to my next pack to skip my period but I started bleeding anyways and bled for about 10 days. I know that breakthrough  bleeding is one of the side effects so I was not too alarmed. My sex drive has been way better and my mood swings have kind of settled down. Please do not let these reviews scare you; try it for yourself. Each body is unique and  reacts differently."
1.0,"Honestly, it did its job in regulating my period but I was a completely different person. I had mood swings, slept for long hours during the day, and was always so drowsy. One of the good things was that it did help with my headaches as well. My acne also got way better and I never had to worry about cramping and heavy bleeding when I  was on my period. I think the hormones really affect one's mood and feelings. Like I said, I didn't like the fact that I slept so much and didn't feel like myself but I appreciate the good things it did. Weight gain wise I'm not sure, I think my appetite got stronger and gained a few pounds on my own but I'm starting a new BC (Mili) and I hope the only side effect is mood changes!"
0.0,"I am 48 and was put on birth control due to heavy long periods, I've never used BC pills before this. I had been bleeding heavy for 38 days and was super anemic so my DR. started me on this BC.  Within 2 hours of taking my 1st pill I stopped bleeding and was just spotting for about a day I was so happy. I wasn't having any bad side effects my period seemed controlled. About 8 weeks went by and I started having bad pain in my leg (it was a weird pain through felt like a charley horse but only when I stood or sat went away when I laid down) about 4 days with the pain I went to the ER and was diagnosed with DVT blood clot. DR. said it was related to the BC."
0.0,"I’ve been on this birth control for 1 month now and it’s true ! It has made me very emotional. I’m already sensitive, but now I’m just overly emotional. I cry I get upset I overthink everything. One morning I was crying for no reason and my Gma was like oh  get off that birth control ,but I’m going to give it 1 more month and see how I feel. Overall I’m not pregnant so it works.  I’ll update you guys. Good luck"
0.0,"I’ve been on this pill for a month. This is my first birth control so I don’t have much experience. But let me just say, I have cried almost everyday since starting, I’ve been moody and depressed for the past 4 weeks, I get extreme headaches AND I’ve been on my period now for nearly 2 weeks so I'm not even having sex anymore. I’m stopping this pill it’s ruining my quality of life and I cannot stand the side effects. And I'm out of town so i need to wait another week before seeing my doctor. Please stay away from this pill find something different it’s not worth it."
0.0,Using Estarylla to treat PCOS has made my period somehow even more painful. My period is heavier and the cramps are unbearable. Definitely going to have to try a different birth control to see if anything changes.
0.0,"I was on Tri-lo-marzia for 4 years until I lost my health insurance and I had to switch to Estarylla. I got it on the pill club. After 3/4 months I started getting EXTREMELY depressed, I feel blank, I have constant brain fog, I  my l don't like my life on this birth control. Also it made my periods way longer and heavier, and my PMS symptoms worse, I have cramps now which I've never had, acne, extreme bloating, spotting a whole week before my period, so many other side effects. I really can't wait to get off of this one I hope everything goes back to normal afterwards."
0.0,"So I’ve been on the pill about a week and a day and I’m not liking it so far. Since I’ve started I’ve been very sleepy and it seems like I’m having the symptoms of the flu. My body is weak and I have no energy to do anything. I read the instructions and it’s telling me I basically have to get used to it since this is my first time but it sucks. I’m tired, weak, I have diarrhea, headaches, the past 2 days I’ve thrown up. It even seems like I’m pregnant almost. I move too much I feel sick or even the sight/smell of something makes me sick. I don’t wanna stop since I want to be careful but jeesh. I don't like feeling like this"
0.0,"I am bleeding soooo heavy, it is now going on a month. This month I have already been through 4 pack of always overnight pads. Clots soo big its scares me. I am crying because me and my fiance are trying to have a baby and this medication has done the complete opposite. I only was put on this for 2 month due to PCOS hormonal acne. I am soooo MAD! DON'T I REPEAT DON'T TAKE ESTARYLLA!!!!"
0.0,"I’ve just reached the one week mark taking this. This is the only birth control I’ve ever tried but I want to constantly scream and cry and like yell. I was kind of depressed I guess you could say before taking this but it has been INSANELY worse since about the 4th pill. Horrible mood constantly I feel so foggy and fatigued. It’s very hard to sleep and stay sleeping I probably sleep for no more than 30-45 mins at a time without waking up.  I also can't fall asleep until like 4am. This occasionally happened before the pill but I was so surprised when this started happening out of no where. I didn’t think it was the birth control until I read that it affected hundreds of other women it was happening to them too. I’ve also noticed my breasts are very very sensitive and growing already, and I'm extremely bloated, only a week and some pants are tighter now. I literally never bloat, if I do it’s so minor I can hardly tell so  I know it’s this pill. I don’t recommend it."
1.0,"I stopped taking Estarylla a few months ago after being on it for almost two years. This was my first birth control I had ever taken, and after reading these reviews, I was freaked out! At first, I did not notice any major side effects. I had not gained any weight, my acne somewhat cleared up, and my periods were almost non-existent. However, I decided to take a break from it because I had major mood swings and was not my normal self. It is different for everyone, but I will definitely be trying a new birth control."
0.0,I’ve been bleeding excessively for three weeks with tons of clots
0.0,"Didn’t work, thank god it’s not twins. About 1 year on it………."
0.0,"All I can say is these pills changed my mood so bad I go from angry to extreme angry then back to normal again? I had to stop taking these pills. They are great, but my hormones where outta this world !! Like literally I felt changes in my mood ! From good to just going bad ... Slight bleeding when my period came."
1.0,"I was on this during high school when my periods were off. It worked amazing, then I found out why my periods were off and stopped taking any. However, now that I am older I needed it as preventative and because my periods were off again. I tried another brand and felt sick 24/7, endless vomiting, and my weight shot up in just 2-3 months from 150lb-190lb. Even though my life style had not changed. I asked to be switched back to Estraylla and immediately the nausea stopped. I feel like I am not on anything at all. My weight is now back down though just to 160lb, it is still a process but a much easier one now. My periods are back to regular which even off of BC was three days a week. My cramps that were always unbelievable are nearly gone every time too. 
It is a very effective preventative as well for my boyfriend and I. Best thing is, with my insurance I get a 3 month supply for under $12. With good RX it is a bit more but still pretty cheap."
0.0,I took it for 3 days then quit. I was nauseated  all the time and had headaches.  I would not recommend  it.
0.0,"I was originally on Femynor and everything was well, then my doctor prescribed me the generic version of it, Estarylla. Estarylla gave me lots of anxiety, mood swings, breast tenderness, upset stomachs daily, and it did nothing to shorten my periods or stop the flow from being so heavy. I decided to finally stop taking it once I began to bleed nonstop everyday for three weeks. I consulted a gyno about it and they swapped me to Loryna. I hope my period stops being such a nightmare."
0,"I started Trinessa in 2009 for contraception after having my first son. However, after almost a year later I began to have debilitating migraines. I mean crawling on the floor from bed to the bathroom migraines. As if that was not bad enough, I had an occasional problem with kidney stones. I had my suspicions that my birth control was the culprit but trusted the company. However, after I ultimately made the decision to forgo Trinessa as my form of birth control..... I no longer had these issues. It has been many year since my last dosage (10 years) and I have yet to have a migraine or kidney stone...."
1,"I've been on it for probably about 7 months and it was SOOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN THE PILL .  I definitely am still a bit more emotional especially on my periods but it regulates my irregular periods though it makes my cramps worse (I normally don’t get cramps at all) at first I did notice my sex drive was gone but now I’d say it’s leveled out a bit to a normal level, only problem is it’s randomly started to irritate my skin very badly and get unbearably itchy and leave dark red squares on my skin that stay for weeks. I might have to switch bc of it but gonna try putting it on my arm instead"
1,"This is the first birth control to actually regulate my periods. I was on the pill for a few years and I’d have maybe 2-3 periods a year and when I did they were so debilitating I was in bed for the entire week. The patch has made my periods lighter, shorter, and I get one every month. I haven’t noticed any side effects and I’m very happy with this method. I recommend trying it if you’re on the fence about it!"
0,"I just tried the Xulane patch for the first time, and I couldn't even make it through the first week, my symptoms were so bad. I felt overwhelming nausea, headaches, hot flashes, and gained 10 lbs in a week despite eating normally. I respect people who do fine with the patch, but it was not for me! I'd been on the pill and had nexplanon in before that, and while they both made me a bit moodier and full of acne, they were nothing like the patch. Next step for me will be trying the copper IUD, since Hormonal birth control does not seem to be working well for me."
0,"I'm 5ft, 95lbs and I lovvvvved the patch when I first started, but on my third week I started to vomit nonstop, uncontrollably.  So I took it off with 3 days left until my period. I tried again after my period to test it out, and on the second night, I woke up at 4 am feeling nauseous. I couldn't go back to sleep and was still nauseous so I took the patch off in bed. I woke up 20 minutes later to throw up bile and went back to sleep."
0,"I was on Depo (the shot) years ago and finally tried this as I was looking for something to control my heavy flow and cramping. The first side effect I noticed immediately was that I was sensitive to the adhesive and became so itchy when the patch was on. It would partially peel a lot. First 3 days with it on, I had terrible migraines which continued until I decided to get off of it 3 months later. It is the highest form of synthetic estrogen birth control so always keep that in mind when deciding whether or not to use it. My doctor told me I could feel free to skip a period or two, so I did. And then my body basically decided to have a period anyways with my usual heavy flow and painful cramping. Even when it wasn’t my “period week,” I would still have mild to painful cramping just about everyday. Didn’t gain any weight, but I was only on it for 3 months. Loss of sex drive for the last 2 months I was on it. In my personal opinion, this was just as worse as the shot."
0,"I'm 18, 5 feet tall, and this was my first experience with birth control....worst possible choice. I put it on the day I started my period, as it stated in the official instructions, and I went to bed that night feeling just...off. A little woozy and very fatigued. I woke up that next morning sick to my stomach. I didn't even eat anything or even drink water before I started vomiting. I couldn't hold down water, tea, saltines, nothing. I kept throwing up for 2 hours before I took myself to the hospital to make the nausea and vomiting stop. I took the patch off before I went and the next day I woke up feeling so much better. I thought it would be an easy method, just change it every week on the same day, but NO. I would not recommend this to anyone. The nausea, dizziness, and overall crappy body feeling is just not worth it. I could not imagine dealing with that for at least a MONTH after starting when I couldn't even handle one day. I am terrified of starting another birth control now."
1,"I've always been sensitive to any hormonal birthcontrol. I tried pills and the ring, both no good with horrible side effects like weight gain or mood changes. I was afraid of going on Xulane but I had no other choice being this non-invasive so I gave it a shot. I've now been on it for 2 YEARS, no side effects except for dry skin on patch areas. The first month I had some sleepiness and a lot of hunger but it went away shortly. Love this! Don't knock it till you try it. It's just a sticker. I recommend doing it on your lower abdomen and switching sides every week."
1,"I've been using Xulane for about 6 months now and it has been great! The first three months I noticed that I was losing a lot of hair and it was worrying me, but that stopped after the first 3 months. Otherwise I get my period on the predicted day every time, my periods are shorter, and it is definitely effective at preventing pregnancy. I have depression and anxiety and it did not impact those at all either. The patch has never fallen off and its easy to hide with clothes and even bathing suits etc. I was so scared to try it out but its actually been really great. Better than taking a pill everyday or getting an IUD."
1,"I really like the idea of it and it almost works really well. It’s common that my patch will be barely hanging in on the day I’m due to change it. I usually have 1-2 fall off before they should which makes using this birth control difficult to use since they offer no option to affordability purchase patches when their product fails. Insurance won’t cover an additional dose (expected) but the company also has no option to purchase 1 patch when their product fails. It’s 180$ Out of pocket if you’d like to keep your period on schedule. Perhaps others in countries with more accessible and equitable healthcare won’t have this issue. In the states, it’s not really practical for me to use this one unfortunately."
1,"I started the patch about 2 years ago. It was a good choice for me because I was forgetful with the pill. My period definitely got lighter, I still get pretty bad cramps. I do use the patch all the time, my gyno told me to take it off for a week every 3-4 months. I love not getting my period unless I decide to! Reading all these reviews made me realize that I think it did make my breasts bigger! They definitely get sore sometimes. The patches rarely falls off or start peeling, I recommend showering and cleaning the area with alcohol to remove all the oil and sweat. I put it on my upper back between my shoulders, I noticed if I put it anywhere the skin moves it would come off. I am a little concerned that it is messing with my mental health. I am bipolar and my medication for that decreases the effectiveness of the birth control. I do recommend the patch though, I do not notice any weight gain or rashes, I also do not notice any headaches when I change it."
0,"Within the first two days I became nauseous. Thinking I could stick it out, I kept going, but I started throwing up every couple hours and had to go home sick. After less than a week and some of the worst nausea of my life that only kept getting worse, I took off the patch. Awful experience."
0,"I started using the patch about 3 months ago. It has been horrible experience, it itches so much and it leaves a burn looking mark on my skin. I had to go back to my Dr so he can give me something else. I was going to be full of patch marks all over my body."
1,"I was on Xulane since 2017 with a break of 6 months. It is indeed a great birth control since I did not get pregnant. In 2019 I started getting dizzy at the end of my patch free week like my body didn’t want me to put another one on so I did a 6 months break. Let me tell you, only when I took that thing off me I realized how much I’m missing. Anxiety and mood swings went away, libido and femininity came back. Blossoming, got into new relationship and decided to go back to the patches. It was ok at first, minor headaches and spotting. A year in I started noticing my sex drive slowly dying off. Then my desire to leave the house. Then my relationship. I took off the patch 3 weeks ago but I’m still experiencing anxiety and feeling really down. I just hope it goes away and I become a happy horn-ball again. I’ll be honest I do recommend the patch TO PREVENT PREGNANCY since pills didn’t work for me and the ring started smelling like urine after a week in. 5/10"
1,"Gave me ZERO negative side effects, shortened my period and almost eliminated cramps as a whole. It didn’t make my skin better but it also didn’t make it worse either. It also does its job I have not gotten pregnant. The only downside is I've never been able to skip my period while on it, it just comes anyway even if I skip the placebos."
0,"I can’t speak for its effectiveness at preventing pregnancy but I wanted to share my experience for PMDD/PMS. I tried Junel Fe in the past and liked it but felt like I was always bloated. Then I asked my gyn if I could try something else because I felt like the Junel helped with anxiety and digestion, but didn’t like some of the effects on mood

I took Apri at night and within 15 minutes I was incredibly drowsy and dizzy. I slept by the toilet all night because I felt like I was on the verge of throwing up but I never did. Horrible headache the next day

If this one doesn’t work for you, try another (: each pill is different and I don’t regret taking it because it told me something about my body. Seriously, don’t be afraid to experiment!"
1,"I used Apri for about 6-7 years and originally went on it for my skin, but then also did need it as birth control. During the last few years, it made my blood pressure rise to around 150 / 90. I spent a while trying to understand what caused the spike but once I fully went off Apri I realized it was directly related. My blood pressure normalized within 3 weeks."
0,This is the worst pill i have ever been on. i had horrible mood swings and my acne was terrible the entire time.
1,"For some context, I am 22 and use this BC for acne/to stop my periods (because my periods have always been extremely painful and extremely heavy, like going through 5 ""overnight 12 hour"" extra heavy an extra long pads in a 10 hour day , unable to function)I just started my 3rd pack today (3 months) of continuous use( without taking the white""sugar pills"")and I haven't had a full period! I will say that I have noticed a bit of spotting/ nausea but I believe that it's mostly due to accidentally being late on a dose due to it starting that next day. I have ALWAYS struggled so bad with cystic, terrible acne and my acne has cleared up INCREDIBLY!! I haven't had any weight gain, no increased appetite, no water retention that I've noticed. I haven't had any kind of mood changes and if anything my mood has gained stability due to no PMS every month. I have noticed breast tenderness and more perky breasts rather than growth in size. I do not use the pill for contraception so I can't speak on that."
1,"I honestly have loved Apri besides 1 thing. Everyone’s bodies are different so please take that into account when reading these reviews. My moods were great, no sex drive changes, skin stayed clear, my only thing was I gained a good amount of weight. I went from a small in bathing suit tops to a large in what felt like over night. It’s been taking a toll on my body imagine but if this didn’t happen I would stay on this for the rest of time!!!"
0,"Apri was my first birth control I started taking when I was 17 and I took it for about 5 months. It was a terrible experience for me I ruined relationships because it seriously made me crazy. The mood swings were awful and I gained a lot of weight. It worked great with preventing pregnancy but, the side effects were unbearable :("
1,"p>		“Seasonique made an incredible difference to my life.  It got rid of my PMDD symptoms, no more hysterical mood swings, no more anxiety or depression before my period. I have classic PMDD, I’ve had it my whole life, my mother and my sister have it too. My mother’s symptoms stopped when she had the menopause, but it ruined her life - job, relationships etc. My symptoms always stopped when I was pregnant as there was a constant supply of oestrogen. I’m so glad I found something that helps. I’m writing this post to maybe help someone else, don’t rely on nature to help you if you have PMDD, see a female doctor who can help you stabilise your hormones. Good luck!”</p"
1,"I started this drug because I have painful cramps and pretty heavy periods and also I have symptoms of PMDD. On the first month my boobs got a bit swollen and tender and I had less depression which was cool.The 2nd month was cool other than occasional spotting. Then on the 3rd month I made the mistake of forgetting my daily pill and my period started and it’s been happening for about 7 days so far and there’s no sign of it stopping. The cramps is bearable though, my flow isn’t as heavy either but i still have some depressive symptoms and mood swings but It’s not as bad as before I took this drug. I don’t think it’s terrible, though and I would take it again since it did reduce my cramps."
1,"Seasonique was prescribed to me by my doctor because after years on Alesse, I started experiencing light spotting about a week before my scheduled period. I also had low iron so my doctor prescribed Seasonique to defer my periods. 
As soon as I started taking this medication, my waist appeared not as lean. I didn’t put on weight, but I’m experiencing water retention and bloat. My boobs are very sore; while they’ve gotten bigger, they’re…not totally even and the largeness sort of makes it a bit more obvious. My right boob needs to catch up, whomp whomp.
With not having a period, I always think I’m pregnant.
6 weeks in and the hunger starts. I’m so hungry that I feel faint. I can pound back food without issue and normal portions don’t fill me up. Also, I’m starting to feel nauseous despite taking it at bedtime."
0,"I was on Seasonique for 4 years, and had to go off of it in 2018 due to financial costs and me living in another country. In 2019, I started gaining excessive amounts of weight, facial hair, extreme hair loss and feeling tired all the time, sometimes sleeping for 12+ hours and still feeling like shit… basically all the signs of PCOS. 

I went to my doctor at the time, and was told I was being irrational for thinking that maybe being off the birth control started something or triggered something. I just got diagnosed with PCOS this year (2022) and my new doctor believes that this birth control caused cysts to form… with me stopping the pills, and my period trying to get back into a normal state of once a month, my body triggered some kind of reaction and now I’m dealing with full on PCOS. I can’t lose the weight, I have to be on a strict diet and constantly shaving my beard. 

It’s not normal to have one period every three months y’all."
1,"I quit taking my old birth control due to my mood fluctuations due to PMDD I was put on Seasonique and it's helped immensely, I'm on my second month of it now.  The only real side effects I experienced were headaches and hot flashes.  But these hot flashes are intense.  I'm only 31 so I wasn't expecting a side effect like that but my Dr said symptoms usually balance out after taking it for 3 months. I'll keep taking it because of how helpful it's been mood wise.  But just know that hot flashes can indeed happen to younger people with a female reproductive system."
0,"I was prescribed Seasonique after struggling with my periods for decades. My doctor tells me to try it for three months. Normally I have a 5-7 day period that starts super heavy and ends light. My cramps are brutal so I’m hoping this will work. I take it every single morning at 6:15 on the dot. I don’t skip or forget. I’m still bleeding now but it’s daily. I’m having terrible cramps that wake me up in the middle of the night. Things aren’t getting better, they’re getting worse. 
 I contacted my doctor and she referred me to a specialist. I’m hopeful something will be done but birth control did nothing except cause more pain.  
If it doesn’t feel right to you, stop taking it. I wish I’d listened to my gut about three months too."
1,"Been on seasonique for about 5 years, switched me to Ashlyna 3 years ago. The first 3 months I recall feeling nauseous and having intermittent spotting, I almost stopped taking the darn thing. After reading reviews to wait it out I can say I'm so glad I did. I no longer have periods, even on my off week. I'm told it's normal and my uterus is fine. I'm no longer building a lining for potential pregnancy that needs to be shed every month. This birth control has leveled out my emotions, I no longer get the moodiness I once did every month. I have gained weight. About 5 lbs or so. Is it my pill or my age? Who could say. I'm not about to stop taking it to find out though. Lol!"
0,"I started taking this pill in Jan. of 2020, I was 18. I stopped taking it in Sept. of 2021. It was my first birth control ever so I overlooked my symptoms a lot. My doctor prescribed Taytulla to help get rid of my ovarian cyst but I decided to keep taking it after it was gone. I gained over 40 lbs in the last year of using it (while working out 5/6 days a week & being underweight my whole life)! My anxiety was the worst, I would have anxiety attacks at work and had to leave early multiple times because I’d pass out. Around the same time, I started having suicidal thoughts. My mood swings were a nightmare for everyone around me, I constantly felt bad. I'd cry all the time and ANYWHERE, it was embarrassing and only made anxiety worse. After stopping, I’ve felt happier, no intense crying, I’ve even lost some weight. My periods are irregular again so I started a new pill. Hope it works better than this one. Good luck to anyone taking Taytulla, I hope you have a better experience."
0,"Taytulla wasn’t the right birth control for me. I was on it for two months before I had to stop because I couldn’t handle the side effects anymore. I never stopped being starving the entire time, regardless of how much I ate. This caused me to feel bloated and miserable all of the time. It caused awful acne that never heals and causes scarring every time I get even a small zit that still hasn’t stopped over a year and a half later. While on the birth control I would have my period starting on day 7 of the pack and it would last until I started a new pack. 

Birth controls are very individual so it may work great for others. However, my gynecologist refused to take any of my symptoms seriously and yelled at me when I refused to continue taking it. So, I’m leaving a review so that if someone encounters the same issue as me they’re able to validate their feelings and switch birth control methods if necessary."
1,"I have PCOS and normally when not on birth control my periods are very heavy and very long ( anywhere from 10-15 days). Birth control pills normally make me very sick as I experience all the usual side effects.

I have been taking lutera 0.1 mg -20 mcg for 5 months now, I take it every night after dinner as directed and I have not experienced any side effects. My periods while taking lutera are still very heavy and painful but last about 3-5 days. So far it hasn't helped much with my PCOS symptoms which are hormonal acne, fatigue and excessive hair growth. 
Really enjoying not experiencing any negative side effects. Dr suggested increasing my dosage if I want it to relieve my PCOS symptoms."
0,"Everyone’s body is different please keep that in mind, so this is the second birth control I’ve tried. I took it Friday the first day of my period at 10 am and later I had the worst nausea I wasn’t able to eat even though I was starving it made my period cramps worse but I didn’t think much considering it was my first day. TMI but later during the day I had sharp pains while I was trying to poop it was so bad I had to grab something and my stomach was so upset then the next day I took it again on time the whole day still nauseous couldn’t even eat one slice of pizza. Then later I had terrible cramps and horrible stomach ache at the same time I went to the bathroom I was feeling dizzy and I was hyperventilating and I had diarrhea and I threw up 3 times I was on the bathroom floor shaking because the cramps were so bad and my body was shocked so basically two days and that’s it for me … THE WORST PAIN I'VE EVER FELT but I don’t think my body goes well with BC ~"
1,"I switched from Junel FE to lutera. I have little to no periods on the placebo pills, some dryness, and low libido. 

In my early 20s I would be all about it, but I’m almost 30s so I’m more concerned than relived. Everyone’s body is different so try and keep what works for you!"
1,"I really liked Lutera, was on it for 6 months but Nurx has decided to send me the generic Vienva for the next 6 months instead. Mood was great on it, didn't experience any weight gain. As someone who has had issues with depression and anxiety, I was worried going from Nuvaring to a pill, but I had no issues with  mental health. In fact, I have felt better than ever. I have previously felt like I have a low sex drive, but this has actually had me feeling pretty good in that regard, and that may be related to how it didn't have effects on my mood.

Everyone's body responds differently to birth control, but Lutera really worked for me.

Hope Vienva is just as good!"
1,"I was on Lessina for about a year and a half, I had a very rough 6-8 months with it until I finally got used to it. My doctor became a mess and gave me an appointment for 4 months from my last packet of pills, so I ended up using GoodRx. They kept me on Lessina since I asked for it, but at the pharmacy they gave me Lutera after all of this time and I was so annoyed and freaked out, but they did me a favor! This pill has worked very well for me. I have not had any significant side effects at all and my migraines significantly improved. I was so scared at the beginning since starting a new brand is like an endless journey of side effects. Everyone reacts different to each birth control, and this one thankfully worked for me. I wish you the best of luck finding one that works for you!"
1,"I tried Depo Provera but it didn't work for me. I experienced VERY HEAVY BLEEDING with clots. Our bodies are all different and the medication /dosage required is different. 

I have now switched to EVRA birth control patch & it is working perfectly for me. I no longer require tranexamic acid. Just glad and grateful to God for these inventions, and that I was able to locate something that works for me. 

I have read several reports on failures and complications of Endometrial ablation and Hysterectomy. I would advise ladies to do their research & be very cautious with such risky procedures even if Doctors suggest it.
It's difficult to be patient when you feel like you're under pressure or even bleeding and Anemic. I suggest prayer, calmness & research. Don't rush into procedure or surgery. 
Removing your uterus or other parts from your body can cause further complications - this has happened to several people. And once you go that route you can't undo your action. Cheers!"
0,I found this website when I was looking for answers of why I felt so sick and I’m really amazed how similar other peoples experiences are to my own! Feeling this nausea of a birth control is baffling how can feeling like you have a stomach bug everyday even pass the factory line! The things that they deem ok side effects for birth control just wouldn’t pass for so many other drugs! I have felt run down and sick for the two weeks I have been using it and the heartburn is something else!! I am unaware if it’s the drug it’s self or the side effect of the side effect of the drug causing such bad nausea!
0,"I started taking Blisovi Fe around 3 months ago. This is the absolute worst birth control I’ve ever been on, first two months didn’t think anything of it. Third month finally realized this is what’s been making my mood swings so bad, crying all the time for no reason, so tired 24/7. Never had this issue on any other birth control. Also caused my boobs to grow."
0,On week 3 on these pills due to my pharmacy giving me these instead my Aurovela FE 1/20 and I already don't like it. I have now more worse acne on my chin area that doesn't seem to go away no matter how much acne treatment I put on them. And just last week I was crying for no reason and seem more moody. Aurovela FE 1/20 may have been not so great for others but it was a calming pill for me and I didn't get bad acne.
1,Been on the pill for probably around a year. I have noticed me gaining weight but my workout and eating habits definitely factor into that. I do find myself nauseous a lot but I correlate that to acid reflux and previous anxiety issues. I don’t really see any negative side effects besides feeling irritable and on edge on the placebo week but it’s helped my periods and ton and I have clear skin. Definitely try it and see if it works for you!
0,"I have been on Blisovi Fe 1/20 for about 2 months. I take birth control because my period is very long, heavy, painful, etc. I was on Lolestrin Fe before taking this and it was actually working but I still wanted a shorter period. Unfortunately in the first month on Blisovi Fe my period lasted about 11 days and less then a week later it started again. It also made me extremely anxious and depressed, to the point of panic attacks almost every week, which is not normal for me. I’ve lost a few pounds while on Blisovi but am constantly bloated since I started taking it. I also started noticing an increase in sinus and respiratory problems which could also be related to this medication. Overall I do not recommend this product."
1,"I wanted to share my experience after reading so many reviews. 
I was on Nuvaring for 3 years prior and I started realizing the 3rd year that I had gained over 30 lbs and could not get it off for the life of me. I went off of Nuvaring about 6 months ago and my weight drastically started going down! I am able to control my weight and lose it. 
Cons of Blisovi Fe 1/20 is that I have spotting in the middle of the month before my period and it continues into my period. Then I get about a week free of spotting and that has been since I started. I realized that I was nauseous when I first started. I thought it was from Covid and taking vitamins on an empty stomach but it was definitely the pill the first 2 months. Now I take the pill in the morning with no nausea. My stomach has been more upset then usual so maybe that’s a con, I’m not sure. As for sleeping, I could barely get 5 hours of sleep on Nuvaring and now I can at least get 7 hrs and I feel a bit more energetic."
0,"It’s been a little over a month for me. I wanted to give it more time, but I have been extremely emotional. I feel like crying all the time for no reason, and I am overly sensitive. I struggle with depression and anxiety, and I was hoping it would have helped. I’ve also gained nearly 10 pounds in the month I’ve been on it (I’m 22 and run about 3 miles a day). I’ve had headaches everyday, and I was super nauseous when I first started the pill (it went away after a week). I wish I could give this pill more time but I’m feeling like things are getting worse than better. I went on the pill to help with my extremely bad PMSing (sadness) but I feel sad all the time now."
1,"I've been on this version for around 10 months. Initially, I really liked it! My breasts were super sore for the first 6 months (and def got bigger) which I didn't particularly mind as I didn't notice any other symptoms. Fast forward to now, and the long-term effects of this pill are coming to light. I've gained 22 lbs since I started (without any changes to diet/exercise), and am still slowly climbing. My body doesn't cooperate with me during exercise like it used to, and I feel out of energy. Also, I stopped getting my period altogether. The most I've ever gotten is a tiny bit of dark-colored discharge during my placebo weeks. I get ""hot flashes"" about 5-6 hours after taking my pill every day and constantly feel warm. I didn't ever notice any changes to my skin at all, but my hair def got a lot greasier. Trial and error! Will be switching."
1,"I started taking this after 5 years of debilitating menstrual migraines. World-ending pain no matter how light my period. My naturopathic doctor and I decided to get rid of my periods by taking this continuously. I was hesitant because of potential side effects, and I'm very sensitive. After about 3 months my period went away completely and my quality of life increased drastically. I no longer have any period, or any menstrual migraine, no side effects that I can tell. I'm very active, yet eat whatever I want. I literally say a prayer of gratitude to science every morning when I take my little pill. Thank you, science."
1,"I’ve been on Blisovi for a little over 2 years now and in the beginning it was great. I really didn’t have many side effects. I got on it for acne purposes and it did a wonderful job clearing up my face within 3 months. However the longer I’ve been taking it the more I’ve been experiencing side affects. Some months around my period I get very Irritable or sad and other months I’m perfectly fine. Some months I experience really bad cramps not even just in my uterus but up into my diaphragm and back. Just seems like every month it’s a new type of side affect. My sex drive was fine taking this until about recently, it’s decreased significantly. Overall I’ve had more good experiences with this birth control than bad but just make sure you are keeping track of side affects even once you have been taking it for awhile!"
1,"i have had a great experience with blisovi- the only negatives are tender breasts/occasional cramping and I noticed some increased appetite. 
Other brands have ruined my mental state, but blisovi didn’t cause anything that isn’t usual. No difference in sex drive and no noticeable weight gain"
0,"Absolutely horrible. I was on another combination pill for about 4 months before this birth control. I was already struggling with the side effects of my previous birth control and Blisovi Ee made it 10x worse. Extreme anxiety, paranoia, weight gain, constant spotting off an on, painful sex (which I’ve never had before this birth control), I starting really despising everyone around me, random pelvic pain, constant bowel movements, and many more. I haven’t even been on this birth control for a whole month.. I genuinely thought I was going crazy and couldn’t figure out why I was having problems till I realized it all matched up to me using this birth control."
0,"I stopped taking this medication after approximately 2.5 months. My doctor prescribed it because of my extremely heavy periods that caused anemia. After 2 months on this medication I experienced the longest and heaviest period of my entire life, 13 straight days of very heavy bleeding. I experienced pelvic pain every single day which was more frequent than before I took the medication. My breasts became bigger and very sore and tender. I bloated up so much. The only ""positive"" thing I got out of this medication was that it subdued my emotions to the point my depression and anxiety improved, but it also subdued any feelings of elation that I used to have. I'm not sexually active so I wasn't taking it to prevent pregnancy. I will never take this stuff again."
0,I am 21 and around 110lbs My doctor prescribed this for me when I was 20 because I was getting married and also for my irregular periods. Which are so bad usually I pass out/faint. I've been taking this for around a year. I have experienced extreme depression and suicidal thoughts. I have gained weight and it has lowered my sex drive and made sex painful. My periods are still irregular.
0,"I took this pill for only a week. I had nausea, vomiting and the worse headaches. I already had anxiety but in just a few days it intensified. I know my dr said it takes time to adjust but there’s no way I could live thru the migraines from this pill and still do every day life!"
1,"I took lo loestrin fe for a month and then switched to blisovi because it was free with my insurance. I was very skeptical of this birth control at first because I experienced breakthrough bleeding for like 3 months straight. I did have some dryness but that seemed to go away after a while. But my weight, skin, libido, mood hasn’t changed at all. I also have always had very heavy periods but now they’re not bad at all. It doesn’t make me nauseous which was my main problem with other birth controls I tried in the past. The only thing I don’t like about it is that my boobs get super tender before/during my period (and they’ve grown but I’m still the same weight somehow lol). But overall I think it does the job."
1,"I’ve been taking this for about a year and 1/2 now. I was diagnosed with PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder), which is basically where you have super PMS when you already have anxiety and/or depression. It was BAD, especially through the pandemic. My doctor prescribed continuous birth control to completely eliminate PMS and periods, and I’ve never felt better! My mood is definitely more stable, and I haven’t experienced any more extreme lows like I used to get. As far as side effects go; my breasts did get bigger at first but the swelling went down after a couple months, and my sex drive has gone down quite a bit. Considering all of the other possible side effects I could have had, I’m totally okay with just that one. Plus, it has done its job well with preventing pregnancy when I am intimate. 

 As a lot of others have said, everyone’s bodies are different and won’t react the same, but that’s just my positive experience on this medication.  :)"
1,"I don't normally comment and I'm only here to see if any reviews talked about getting pregnant after stopping Blisovi (I plan to stop taking it soon to start trying for a pregnancy). However, I wanted to share my experience because it's been much more positive than the other reviews. I switched to Blisovi after taking the Depo Provera shot for about 5 years. While on the shot I was often depressed/anxious and had moderate acne. Once I switched to Blisovi, my anxiety and depression decreased and my face has not been this clear since before puberty (even my acne scars are healing!). I don't take the sugar pill, so I have not had a period while on it (except after my covid shot, which was weird). My weight has been consistent and I have not noticed any other symptoms. I take the pill about the same time every day, plus it minus an hour or two. I haven't noticed any problems if I take it a bit later than usual. I've been on it for about 2 years now. It works for me and my body."
0,"These reviews are saving my life. My moods have been the ABSOLUTE WORST since starting Blisovi back in December. I have said things I never ever would have said, I snap say people, I cry at every little thing. My poor friends have been on the receiving end of all of this. I'll be surprised if they're still my friends. I feel like absolute garbage. 

I also take medication for migraines, which also happens to be an anti-depressant, so I wonder if these two medications are not working well together?

I'm calling my OBGYN tomorrow to get off of this medication. I can't deal with this. I want to be myself again."
1.0,"I’ve been on Vienva since December of 2021 so it’s been about 5 months now. It’s the first birth control I’ve ever taken so I wasn’t 100% sure what was going to happen going into it. The first month was fine, no side effects and my period was like it normally was, but then I got to the second month and it was a nightmare. Every night I’d get EXTREME nausea to the point where I couldn’t drive and all I wanted to do was curl up in my bed and not move. This persisted till my 4th pack and since then everything has been fine. I get kind of moody here and there, my acne has stayed about the same, and I think I’ve put on a little weight (tho that could be because of my current diet) but my period has become super light and now only lasts 3-5 days rather than my previous 7 days. I had breakthrough spotting through my 3rd pack but that was the only time it made me bleed irregularly."
0.0,"I shall preface this by saying that I’ve been on multiple different brands of birth control and depo provera since I was 16 years old. I am 20 now. I have been taking Vienna for about 8 months now and I’ve noticed that since I’ve been taking it I have an increase of acne. Previously I’ve never had chin or hormonal acne but that is now something I have because of this medication. Also at least 3 x a month I’ll wake up from my sleep extremely nauseous and usually have an episode of vomiting. I am currently typing this from my bathroom floor as tonight is one of those nights. For pros, this birth control does its primary job well aka preventing pregnancy. Also I deal with extremely horrible long periods and  vienva has somewhat helped with that. It’s kind of hit or miss as sometimes I’ll get my period 2x in a month or I’ll get it once for only 5 days (amazing for me). Overall I don’t think this pill is awful however I don’t think it’s compatible with me."
1.0,"Honestly I was in tears once I was prescribed this and then looked at the reviews. I haven’t had any weight gain, I have clearer skin, and I don’t have any issues with mood. Perhaps maybe in the first month I was a little moody and sensitive but after having my first period everything was fine. I honestly feel normal and am writing this for anyone who was like me and freaking out when reading these. You’ll never know until you try but I was previously taking Lutera with Nurx and switched to this as it was cheaper with The Pill Club ."
1.0,I’ve been on this for about 5-6 months and the only issue I have is occasional breakthrough bleeding but only 2 times. When I first started I did have headaches however it went away after a month. And this didn’t change my weight so far but has made my boobs a lot bigger. I personally never take the placebo pills the one time I did it took like 3 days for my period to come but other than that no issues!
0.0,I recently got my implant removed and my doctor put me on this. I take it and everything is going well until the late evening I have horrible nausea which led to vomiting. One day in and I’m already not liking this pill. My other pills I took in the past never gave me nausea this bad. I won’t be taking anymore pills.
1.0,"I’ve had a great experience with this birth control! Everyone says they got sore boobs and spotting, but I had zero side affects. My period is back (which I wanted) on time and the cramping is a pretty moderate amount. Perfect for me."
0.0,I switched to Vienva after being on the same birth control for years because my doctor thought it might help with my migraines. I read a lot of negative reviews on it but I think most pills have that. I’ve been on it for around 3 months now and it’s been an awful experience! it’s made me feel absolutely crazy and a lot more emotional than I’m used to. I don’t usually go long periods of time feeling depressed but this definitely changed that. I’ve never felt so less in control of my emotions ever. It’s had me rethinking my entire life and crying at everything. I’ve tried waiting it out but I’m switching back to my original pack! Birth control pills have a different effect on everyone but this did not work for me. My therapist said I sound like a woman experiencing postpartum depression… except I have no kids !
1.0,"The only complaint I have, is having no sex drive! Other than that, I have no side effects from Vienva. In fact, my skin has been its clearest and no weight gain."
1.0,"I honestly love Vienva. I’ve been on Vienva a little over a year in 7 months & I have never experienced any side effects. Don’t let reviews scare you, I’m not saying that it’s impossible to have side effects. Everybody body is different and will have a different reaction, but I think it’s worth giving a try. I also recommend Vienva to a friend and she didn’t have any side effects either."
1.0,"I was prescribed Lutera before, but was given the generic version through NuRx. I lost 9lbs on Lutera over 4 months which was a blessing since I had been trying to lose weight for 2 1/2 years and was hoping to lose more weight. Then I was prescribed Vienva, its generic version. The good, I have less migraines, in a better mood, facial hair growth has slowed down which has reduced some acne caused by it.

The bad, I've gained 11 lbs in 3 weeks since I've been on Vienva, I have this constant I'm hungry urge and my period lasted 8 days with the same blood flow for 7 out of those 8 days. It's a new BC so I'm going to see how my body reacts to it after the 3 months, but so far I am too not happy with this BC. Probably wouldn't recommend if you are overweight and have been trying to and have lost weight as it can really ruin whatever work you've done. If you can try it out for 3 months and see how it goes, I'd say give it a shot. Every body works differently."
0.0,I was prescribed Vienva and the first few months were fine. I was originally on a different birth control called Yaz I think. I started getting acne so that’s why I switched. After about 3 months of using Vienva I started getting SEVERE acne and some bloating. I eventually decided enough was enough and I quit using birth control all together. My acne is pretty much all gone after being 2 months off of Vienva but I have so many acne scars on my face. The deciding factor for getting off of birth control was when I looked up the side effects of it and the first one was ACNE. This shouldn’t persuade you not to take it because everyone has differing experiences with medications. I signed up for the pill club and was prescribed the birth control by them so it was super easy to get but if you have problems with acne I do not recommend it.
1.0,"I just finished my third month on Vienva. I started Vienva after a horrible experience with the implant birth control. Vienva has been pretty great, no major side effects. My face is the clearest it has ever been, no weight gain, no mood swings. I am pretty sensitive to birth controls, so this is definitely a pretty good one. I still bloat pretty bad but that's about it."
1.0,"Okay so let me say I was TERRIFIED of starting my birth control after reading these reviews. HOWEVER I’ve been on Vienva for about a month now and I have had very few side affects. I know it is still early in the adjustment process but I haven’t noticed any weight gain, my skin has actually started to clear slightly, and it hasn’t made me nauseous. I will say that I’ve been a bit bloated and my boobs are a little tender (and slightly bigger which is a win in my book) but nothing to bad. I promise you people are more likely to leave reviews when things are bad so I wanted to make sure and say how happy I’ve been thus far with this bc."
1.0,"It was okay I got it from nurx and the reason I’m on birth control is because without it I won’t get my period. Unfortunately, I’ve had lots of mood swings with this one but that’s pretty much it. I don’t know whether to attribute my weight gain to this or if it’s because I’m a big girl now but idk. It’s okay, I’ve had better. Mood swings have been kicking tho, but that could be reactionary to my ADHD (I don’t take meds for it)"
1.0,"I am currently on my 4th month under Vienva. The first month was awful for me when it came to my mental health. I was crying out of nowhere and I was really depressed. I started taking birth control just to prevent pregnancy as me and my significant other aren't ready for kids yet. I decided to keep taking it and after my first month, I was back to normal. It helped clear up my acne and my bra size went up from 36C to a 36 DD. I gained 10 lbs but I honestly didn't mind the weight gain. Every woman will have different stories it's just up to how your body takes it. personally, I think it's a good decision and it definitely works. Honestly, Im glad I started taking it : )"
0.0,My pharmacy declared Lutera to be discontinued by manufacturer and had me try this. I had 4 brand spanking new periods each week while on this and promptly tried Aviane which was similar enough to Lutera.
1.0,"This birth control for me personally really helped my mental health after being on Sprintec, which gave me really bad anxiety and emotional mood swings. My mental state has never felt better than being on this pill. However, I'm having way worse of physical side affects now than on my old pill. Intercourse is extremely painful, even putting in a tampon feels like it’s burning. I never had this issue before. It’s also made my acne worse than ever (I get hormonal acne easily). On the plus side it hasn’t made me gain any weight. If you’re using this pill for reasons other than a birth control, it’s great. However if you’re using it to have unprotected sex then it’s kind of pointless because sex has become so painful and it lowers your libido too. However, every person is different, so what doesn’t work for me might work for you."
1.0,"I needed to regulate my period because it was so irregular and the cramps were so painful that I'd blackout before. I started getting this brand through Pill Club and haven't had much issue with it. My periods are much lighter, I always know what day and time the flow will really start flowing. I gained weight, but no clue if it's the birth control or less working out during the pandemic. My acne is also totally manageable now! I had bad hormonal acne before and now I'll just get the occasional ones right before/during my period. Boobs didn't grow or anything. Have been a bit more gassy, but overall not too bad. If this one did not work for you, don't be discouraged because it took me about three brands before this to find one that didn't completely mess up my body in some way. Continue to be patient and update your doctor. Good luck!"
0.0,"Just started week three, and completely devastated. My face has broken out into a complete mess, and is so painful. I was treated for a UTI at week 2 and now appear to have a yeast infection. Huge decrease in sex drive and increase in vaginal discomfort and dryness. A lot of mention has been made to mood swings/depression, but I cannot say if that is a side effect of the medication, or because all the other side effects have made me so miserable. I would not recommend this pill."
1.0,It’s okay. It does its job.  I was scared of the reviews too but I thought I add one and say it’s not a nightmare.  Could be better though.  I’ve always battled acne and this made my acne like 30% better after 3 months?? Tbh it doesn’t do much service for acne.  But I haven’t gotten pregnant so yay
1.0,So I’ve been on this pill for 9 months. The first few months I was fine there was no noticeable changes. I started to get mild/moderate headaches when I would be on the inactive pills. Recently I’ve been overly fatigued and I'm not sure it’s from the pill or not. I’ve been having at least 8 hours of sleep a night so I'm thinking it’s the pill. Occasionally I get SEVERE leg pain at night and it’s so bad I CRY it’s like this burning/right sensation. It’s only happened like twice again I don’t know if it’s from the pill or not. Overall It’s been an average experience I'm going to stop taking it though and switch to an iud :)
1.0,"I love this birth control! I have had minor side effects. Nothing crazy. I did lose weight but I also have MAJOR cravings. I would say, for me the first day after starting a new birth control pack is I get super irritated. After that I'm totally fine. I am someone who has horrible period cramps. I had minor cramping and my period was super light."
1.0,"I've been on Vienva for less than a month and I haven’t really noticed any big side effects besides a bit of breakthrough bleeding. I think this is a pretty good birth control so far. all the negative reviews scared me but my experience hasn’t been too bad! if you’re feeling anxious about taking this, its normal, but don't let it scare you too much!"
1.0,"Literally no issues at all, no changes, I flipped out when I read the terrible reviews but I love this brand. It all depends on the person but personal I’ve had no changes."
1.0,"I’ve been on Vienva since December of 2021 so it’s been about 5 months now. It’s the first birth control I’ve ever taken so I wasn’t 100% sure what was going to happen going into it. The first month was fine, no side effects and my period was like it normally was, but then I got to the second month and it was a nightmare. Every night I’d get EXTREME nausea to the point where I couldn’t drive and all I wanted to do was curl up in my bed and not move. This persisted till my 4th pack and since then everything has been fine. I get kind of moody here and there, my acne has stayed about the same, and I think I’ve put on a little weight (tho that could be because of my current diet) but my period has become super light and now only lasts 3-5 days rather than my previous 7 days. I had breakthrough spotting through my 3rd pack but that was the only time it made me bleed irregularly."
0.0,"I shall preface this by saying that I’ve been on multiple different brands of birth control and depo provera since I was 16 years old. I am 20 now. I have been taking Vienna for about 8 months now and I’ve noticed that since I’ve been taking it I have an increase of acne. Previously I’ve never had chin or hormonal acne but that is now something I have because of this medication. Also at least 3 x a month I’ll wake up from my sleep extremely nauseous and usually have an episode of vomiting. I am currently typing this from my bathroom floor as tonight is one of those nights. For pros, this birth control does its primary job well aka preventing pregnancy. Also I deal with extremely horrible long periods and  vienva has somewhat helped with that. It’s kind of hit or miss as sometimes I’ll get my period 2x in a month or I’ll get it once for only 5 days (amazing for me). Overall I don’t think this pill is awful however I don’t think it’s compatible with me."
1.0,"Honestly I was in tears once I was prescribed this and then looked at the reviews. I haven’t had any weight gain, I have clearer skin, and I don’t have any issues with mood. Perhaps maybe in the first month I was a little moody and sensitive but after having my first period everything was fine. I honestly feel normal and am writing this for anyone who was like me and freaking out when reading these. You’ll never know until you try but I was previously taking Lutera with Nurx and switched to this as it was cheaper with The Pill Club ."
1.0,I’ve been on this for about 5-6 months and the only issue I have is occasional breakthrough bleeding but only 2 times. When I first started I did have headaches however it went away after a month. And this didn’t change my weight so far but has made my boobs a lot bigger. I personally never take the placebo pills the one time I did it took like 3 days for my period to come but other than that no issues!
0.0,I recently got my implant removed and my doctor put me on this. I take it and everything is going well until the late evening I have horrible nausea which led to vomiting. One day in and I’m already not liking this pill. My other pills I took in the past never gave me nausea this bad. I won’t be taking anymore pills.
1.0,"I’ve had a great experience with this birth control! Everyone says they got sore boobs and spotting, but I had zero side affects. My period is back (which I wanted) on time and the cramping is a pretty moderate amount. Perfect for me."
0.0,I switched to Vienva after being on the same birth control for years because my doctor thought it might help with my migraines. I read a lot of negative reviews on it but I think most pills have that. I’ve been on it for around 3 months now and it’s been an awful experience! it’s made me feel absolutely crazy and a lot more emotional than I’m used to. I don’t usually go long periods of time feeling depressed but this definitely changed that. I’ve never felt so less in control of my emotions ever. It’s had me rethinking my entire life and crying at everything. I’ve tried waiting it out but I’m switching back to my original pack! Birth control pills have a different effect on everyone but this did not work for me. My therapist said I sound like a woman experiencing postpartum depression… except I have no kids !
1.0,"The only complaint I have, is having no sex drive! Other than that, I have no side effects from Vienva. In fact, my skin has been its clearest and no weight gain."
1.0,"I honestly love Vienva. I’ve been on Vienva a little over a year in 7 months & I have never experienced any side effects. Don’t let reviews scare you, I’m not saying that it’s impossible to have side effects. Everybody body is different and will have a different reaction, but I think it’s worth giving a try. I also recommend Vienva to a friend and she didn’t have any side effects either."
1.0,"I was prescribed Lutera before, but was given the generic version through NuRx. I lost 9lbs on Lutera over 4 months which was a blessing since I had been trying to lose weight for 2 1/2 years and was hoping to lose more weight. Then I was prescribed Vienva, its generic version. The good, I have less migraines, in a better mood, facial hair growth has slowed down which has reduced some acne caused by it.

The bad, I've gained 11 lbs in 3 weeks since I've been on Vienva, I have this constant I'm hungry urge and my period lasted 8 days with the same blood flow for 7 out of those 8 days. It's a new BC so I'm going to see how my body reacts to it after the 3 months, but so far I am too not happy with this BC. Probably wouldn't recommend if you are overweight and have been trying to and have lost weight as it can really ruin whatever work you've done. If you can try it out for 3 months and see how it goes, I'd say give it a shot. Every body works differently."
0.0,I was prescribed Vienva and the first few months were fine. I was originally on a different birth control called Yaz I think. I started getting acne so that’s why I switched. After about 3 months of using Vienva I started getting SEVERE acne and some bloating. I eventually decided enough was enough and I quit using birth control all together. My acne is pretty much all gone after being 2 months off of Vienva but I have so many acne scars on my face. The deciding factor for getting off of birth control was when I looked up the side effects of it and the first one was ACNE. This shouldn’t persuade you not to take it because everyone has differing experiences with medications. I signed up for the pill club and was prescribed the birth control by them so it was super easy to get but if you have problems with acne I do not recommend it.
1.0,"I just finished my third month on Vienva. I started Vienva after a horrible experience with the implant birth control. Vienva has been pretty great, no major side effects. My face is the clearest it has ever been, no weight gain, no mood swings. I am pretty sensitive to birth controls, so this is definitely a pretty good one. I still bloat pretty bad but that's about it."
1.0,"Okay so let me say I was TERRIFIED of starting my birth control after reading these reviews. HOWEVER I’ve been on Vienva for about a month now and I have had very few side affects. I know it is still early in the adjustment process but I haven’t noticed any weight gain, my skin has actually started to clear slightly, and it hasn’t made me nauseous. I will say that I’ve been a bit bloated and my boobs are a little tender (and slightly bigger which is a win in my book) but nothing to bad. I promise you people are more likely to leave reviews when things are bad so I wanted to make sure and say how happy I’ve been thus far with this bc."
1.0,"It was okay I got it from nurx and the reason I’m on birth control is because without it I won’t get my period. Unfortunately, I’ve had lots of mood swings with this one but that’s pretty much it. I don’t know whether to attribute my weight gain to this or if it’s because I’m a big girl now but idk. It’s okay, I’ve had better. Mood swings have been kicking tho, but that could be reactionary to my ADHD (I don’t take meds for it)"
1.0,"I am currently on my 4th month under Vienva. The first month was awful for me when it came to my mental health. I was crying out of nowhere and I was really depressed. I started taking birth control just to prevent pregnancy as me and my significant other aren't ready for kids yet. I decided to keep taking it and after my first month, I was back to normal. It helped clear up my acne and my bra size went up from 36C to a 36 DD. I gained 10 lbs but I honestly didn't mind the weight gain. Every woman will have different stories it's just up to how your body takes it. personally, I think it's a good decision and it definitely works. Honestly, Im glad I started taking it : )"
0.0,My pharmacy declared Lutera to be discontinued by manufacturer and had me try this. I had 4 brand spanking new periods each week while on this and promptly tried Aviane which was similar enough to Lutera.
1.0,"This birth control for me personally really helped my mental health after being on Sprintec, which gave me really bad anxiety and emotional mood swings. My mental state has never felt better than being on this pill. However, I'm having way worse of physical side affects now than on my old pill. Intercourse is extremely painful, even putting in a tampon feels like it’s burning. I never had this issue before. It’s also made my acne worse than ever (I get hormonal acne easily). On the plus side it hasn’t made me gain any weight. If you’re using this pill for reasons other than a birth control, it’s great. However if you’re using it to have unprotected sex then it’s kind of pointless because sex has become so painful and it lowers your libido too. However, every person is different, so what doesn’t work for me might work for you."
1.0,"I needed to regulate my period because it was so irregular and the cramps were so painful that I'd blackout before. I started getting this brand through Pill Club and haven't had much issue with it. My periods are much lighter, I always know what day and time the flow will really start flowing. I gained weight, but no clue if it's the birth control or less working out during the pandemic. My acne is also totally manageable now! I had bad hormonal acne before and now I'll just get the occasional ones right before/during my period. Boobs didn't grow or anything. Have been a bit more gassy, but overall not too bad. If this one did not work for you, don't be discouraged because it took me about three brands before this to find one that didn't completely mess up my body in some way. Continue to be patient and update your doctor. Good luck!"
0.0,"Just started week three, and completely devastated. My face has broken out into a complete mess, and is so painful. I was treated for a UTI at week 2 and now appear to have a yeast infection. Huge decrease in sex drive and increase in vaginal discomfort and dryness. A lot of mention has been made to mood swings/depression, but I cannot say if that is a side effect of the medication, or because all the other side effects have made me so miserable. I would not recommend this pill."
1.0,It’s okay. It does its job.  I was scared of the reviews too but I thought I add one and say it’s not a nightmare.  Could be better though.  I’ve always battled acne and this made my acne like 30% better after 3 months?? Tbh it doesn’t do much service for acne.  But I haven’t gotten pregnant so yay
1.0,So I’ve been on this pill for 9 months. The first few months I was fine there was no noticeable changes. I started to get mild/moderate headaches when I would be on the inactive pills. Recently I’ve been overly fatigued and I'm not sure it’s from the pill or not. I’ve been having at least 8 hours of sleep a night so I'm thinking it’s the pill. Occasionally I get SEVERE leg pain at night and it’s so bad I CRY it’s like this burning/right sensation. It’s only happened like twice again I don’t know if it’s from the pill or not. Overall It’s been an average experience I'm going to stop taking it though and switch to an iud :)
1.0,"I love this birth control! I have had minor side effects. Nothing crazy. I did lose weight but I also have MAJOR cravings. I would say, for me the first day after starting a new birth control pack is I get super irritated. After that I'm totally fine. I am someone who has horrible period cramps. I had minor cramping and my period was super light."
1.0,"I've been on Vienva for less than a month and I haven’t really noticed any big side effects besides a bit of breakthrough bleeding. I think this is a pretty good birth control so far. all the negative reviews scared me but my experience hasn’t been too bad! if you’re feeling anxious about taking this, its normal, but don't let it scare you too much!"
1.0,"Literally no issues at all, no changes, I flipped out when I read the terrible reviews but I love this brand. It all depends on the person but personal I’ve had no changes."
1.0,"Been on it for maybe 2 years. No side effects for me. No hair loss. Cramps are rare, periods are shorter. No acne. I’m 19 been using this since my senior year. I encourage you to try it for yourself."
0.0,"I have been taking Vienna for almost 3 years now, but recently opted for a new BC. My anxiety has progressively gotten worse, my boobs are always so tender (and have grown from C cup to DD). I have irregular bleeding even when taking the pills regularly and worst of all, I developed night sweats!!!!! I haven’t read anybody talk about the night sweats, but I saw one review mentions hot flashes. I am literally 27, so I’m nowhere near menopausal age. Oh, the worst for me was the terrible cramping during rough sex! I remember when I first switched to this BC, the second time I slept with my now boyfriend I started having the most intense abdominal pain I had ever felt. He had to give me Advil and place a warm towel on my stomach. I should’ve switched right then, but I loved that I didn’t get dried out like with my old BC. Pros- I didn’t get acne, headaches, nausea, or pregnant(thank god)"
1.0,"I went 2 years bleeding for 3-4 months straight, then not bleeding for a couple weeks, then back to bleeding for 3-4 months. I developed bradycardia and anemia, both were treated with bio-identical progesterone and an iron supplement, but I still kept bleeding. When I say bleeding I mean changing my pad every hour, flooding all over myself with no warning, ruining furniture, my car seat...I did not swim in my pool for 2 years. The painful cramps were unbearable and required pain medicine. Finally by GP suggested Provera, I was nervous because I had heard about the cancer risk, but I just cannot live this way anymore. So I am on day 12ish and the heavy bleeding has slowed, I no longer had super bad cramps. I do still feel some slight cramping, more like pressure from time to time and I am only spotting. I have to take pills a day. I go all day without spotting, but if I wait too long to take my second pill, I spot just a tiny bit. What is going on? Does this sound normal?"
1.0,"I had a lightish period a few days before Xmas, which was a surprise as hadn't had periods for nearly 20 years was on depo injections which stopped them. Last year changed to the rod, same, no periods. Since boxing day none stop flooding, tried two or three different meds and end of February  was given provera (god send) within two weeks eventually stopped, still had the cramping but has  just started to subside. I would rate this med, however I've been told to take 1 x 10mg three times a day, I have been getting lingering headaches, and some constipation, I'm wondering now my bleeding stopped, my dosage should be lowered, hospital want me to stay on them til June. It was such a huge relief when bleeding stopped. Couldn't walk far, so tired all the time, became anaemic, cramping and back ache so painful. Provera ended this eventually."
1.0,"I had irregular period for 3 years and when I went to the doctor, the doctor said I have polycystic ovary syndrome, she prescribed provera 10mg for days ,after taking it for  l0 days I saw my period.  If you don't see your period try provera it will help you regulate your period"
1.0,"Given to induce shedding of lining as I do not get a regular period due to PCOS . 
Took 30mg for 5 days (3 pills a day spaced out) .
I am on the 7th day where I have not taken a pill. No bleed yet but little spotting everyday .

If you have mental health problems they will be exacerbated , I have had crying spells for no reason and anxiety and extreme depression after stopping provera . 
I have BPD , so I think thats also a reason why my mood is so bad . 

Just a warning to anyone with any mental health diagnosis or depression and anxiety 
I don't think I'd be willing to go through this again."
0.0,"p>		“I've been taking Provera twice daily at the instruction of my GP to stop my periods - I'm a trans man and it's a source of dysphoria for me, but I've also had painful periods for years. It prevented my period for about four/five weeks, but now I've been bleeding constantly. It's considerably less painful but totally defeats the purpose of me taking it.”</p"
1.0,"I found first time it worked great for me and amazing as I didn't have a period for 6 months and second time again. I took it this time, my period stopped after 3 days then started again  and hasn't stopped ."
0.0,"I'm 45, and after over a month and a half of vaginal bleeding, I went to the ER. It was scaring me because I'd never had a period for that long and I'm anemic. After the most painful ultrasound I'd ever had in my life, I was told there were no ""obvious"" fibroids, the lining of my uterus was thick, but that was it. Nothing was wrong. The doctor even told me I wasn't anemic at all, and my blood count was normal! He prescribed me 10MG of Medroxy/Provera and I had 7 pills. Took them every day, on time, and never missed a dose. While taking them, the bleeding stopped. I was so relieved, thinking my problems were over! Right after I took the last pill, I noticed a little bit of blood. Since Monday of this week (2-7-2022). I have been subjected to the single worst period I've ever had. Bleeding so heavy, I've had it dripping down my legs. I'm afraid to go to sleep and change my thick pads AND tampons every hour on the hour. I'm afraid my anemia's back, and I'm exhausted. I'm at a loss now."
0.0,"Two years ago, at 48, I already had years of perimenopausal issues, but I started getting heavy periods w/ cramps & huge clots, lasting over 1 week. Then, I had the worst period for 2 weeks, using tampons & pads each hour. My gyno gave me Provera 10 mg, and my period stopped after 3 days. Weirdly, I had no period after for 11 months! Then, my periods came back- some light, some heavy. This went on for 8 months; then, no periods, again. At the end of 2021, my gyno was going to do an ablation on me, but a pre-biopsy showed I have hyperplasia. To reverse this, or else need a hysterectomy, my gyno put me on Provera 10 mg, again, daily, for 3 months. The first 4 weeks were great, no period. But, I slowly started to get very heavy bleeding, cramps & big clots, and I’ve had these things now for 25 days! My gyno did another biopsy 3 days ago, which I’m waiting for the results. She also had me stop the Provera for 1 week, but my period hasn’t stopped, yet. A hysterectomy is sounding better every day!"
1.0,I experience severe as normal bleeding for 3 months straight heavy at times started in June saw the doctor she told me that the Mirena IUD would help but I broke out in a rash so I had that removed in July my next option was Provera ..I was told the bleeding would stop in 10 days but I  bled for 3 months Non-Stop great news is it finally stopped at the end of October and hasnt came back as long as I stay on the 10 mg dose everyday ..I almost gave up because I could not deal with the heavy bleeding ..I had no life I stay home because i feared I I have an episode blood just gushing everywhere's.. believe me when I say it does eventually work for some it works sooner for some it takes longer you just have to be consistent with your dosage and the time that you take..provera has given me my life back
0.0,"I have been bleeding for 7-1/2 weeks now. I saw an ob-gyne on my 5th week of bleeding and I told him about my case.
I have been having this problem since 2018. First I didn't bleed for 2 months, then I had bleeding for 3 weeks, and so on. First my ob in the Philippines gave me norethindrone to regulate my period. I took it for 10 days then I had withdrawal bleeding after 3 days. I did 3 cycles of it and it did regulate my period again.Then in 2020 it happened again. 2021 it has gotten worse. I won't get my period for 3 months then I will bleed for 1 month. And now is the longest. The ob prescribed this pill and it hasn't stopped my bleeding. Its been 3 days since I finished taking it and now it has got heavier. I don't know what to do now."
0.0,"I was prescribed 10mg of Provera daily beginning on December 16th to control a nine month continuous menstrual bleed.  It is now January 5th and there are no signs of this nightmare ending. This drug has left me side effects of anxiety, depression, exhaustion , heart palpitations, headaches, and of course still bleeding with clots the size of my fist! Doctors don’t return call and  appointments aren’t available until over a month away!  I’ve suffered far too long and I’m about to give up. My quality of life is pretty low right now.  I have an appointment with a new obgyn, so I’m hoping for answers and an end to this mess. Maybe I’ll be in bad enough shape for an emergency hysterectomy while I’m there.  My career is about to end due to the inability to leave home without bleeding all over the place! I’m 49 years old and I feel like I’ve wasted a year trapped in my home from this.  This medication has been as useless."
1.0,"I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend and he came inside of me. It was right during my ovulation period. Actually that day I went and bought ovulation test kits and also the Take Action pill. When I took the ovulation kit, the results showed I was pretty close to ovulation so I took the Take Action pill.

I didn’t experience any side effects at all. My period actually came on it’s scheduled predicted day about 2 weeks later.  I was not expecting that. Leading up to my period, for a few days I experienced what I wouldn’t even consider cramps, but light tugging? I also got really awful lower back pain leading up to my period and even still had it on the day I got it. Never really get back cramps and I’m not sure if that’s even related or not. I do have some history of back spasms once in a blue moon so that just might be coincidence."
0.0,"So basically I had unprotected sex three days after my period. He finished outside of me, but we wanted to be safe. The store was out of plan b, so I took take action. I had light bleeding 5 days after the pill and felt very sick. I didn’t get my period for another month after this. I ended up having another 4 day period two weeks later. This pill works, but definitely messes with your hormones."
0.0,So I taken this tablet about a month ago. I'm a 42 year old woman and been married for twelve years. Really with the way the world is going right now I do not want to have kids and we had a scare. I went to Rite Aid and purchased this for around $30 almost immediately after the mess up happen. It has been over a month. I am extremely still bloated and look 6 months pregnant. I have not got my monthly cycle I am extremely late and I've taken 6 pregnancy tests and they are all negative. I would not advise anybody to this pill. Since I've taken it I have been fatigued to the point where I can't get up out of bed. This one pill completely messes up your hormones. I feel like I'm going to die every day since I took it that one day.
0.0,"I had sex February 18 and February 20 I have taken two pills for both of my incidents and I have yet to have a period and usually start in the middle of the month   so I’m not sure what’s going on. I have all the pregnancy symptoms (breast tenderness and blue veins, very very bloated that won’t go away), I’ve had these symptoms for about 2 weeks I’d say. I also thought I started my period on March 15 but it turns out it only lasted one day. But I’m just keep thinking that I’ve taken a large dosage and it’s probably been messing my body up right now but will be taking a test soon. I am very one unlucky gal so it wouldn’t surprise me if It’s not good news to me. I’ve taken this pill before and it worked so hope for some good news."
1.0,"I had gotten my period on January 9th then had sex on January 16th. Took Take Action the next day (11th day of ovulation) I typically ovulate on day 14. Fast forward to January 26th, I had gotten my period 10 days early. Then on February 5th took another Take Action 1 day after sex and 5 days later had brown moderate bleeding for 7 days. On February 26th started to get sore breasts frequent urination, mood swings etc. I thought I was pregnant because I wasn't sure when my period was supposed to come. Now finally yesterday March 8th, my period came. This pill worked but really messes up your cycle and hormones."
1.0,"I'm uncertain tbh. Late night of 2/19 had unprotected sex, husband fully came in me & no BC. I was in my predicted fertile window (period was started 2/13). Approx 12-14 hours later I took Take Action (pharmacist recommendation). I’ve only taken Plan B in the past & was on BC previous times but never had symptoms. Take action-I was very depressed during the first week. 2/25 had spotting, I googled bc my period had just ended & read potential preg symptoms or take action side effects or early period. Went from spotting to bleeding, has been brownish, pink, red…I’ll think it’s over but then it gets heavy again. Today is 3/1 & I’m still bleeding…not nearly as heavy as my period & the heaviest bleeds are consistent. I had mood swings, bloating, some cramping, fatigue, CRAVINGS. Nipple tenderness started today. I’m going to take a pregnancy test to ease my mind. Period is predicted for 3/10. I’ll stick to Plan B. Praying for NO long term hormone imbalances! Will update!"
1.0,Took this take action pill and 2 days later I been having severe cramps hurt do bad I can feel it in my butt it's been going on for 2 days straight now
1.0,"I’ve taken this EC before, and occasionally had a 1 to 2 week late period because of it. But this time around, I’ve started my period a full 2 weeks early. So take note that either side effect Is normal, and Can happen after taking Take Action.
I’m 196 pounds, but only take 1 dose for reference."
1.0,My bf came in me on December 15th I immediately went to Walgreens to get a plan B but they were out. So I got a take action pill instead. I took it around an hour after we had sex. My period was suppose to come on January the 12th but it didn’t. So I assumed the pill was going to cause me to be a few days late just like a Plan B would but nooo. This pill stressed me out!!!!! I was scared to take a pregnancy test because I didn’t want to know the answer but days kept on going by without my period but still I just waited it out. Then my period came on!…..BUT IT WAS 11 DAYS LATE! My periods are regular so I’ve never been so scared. It works but depending on your body you have to give it time. I also started my birth control the same day I took the take action pill. I also weigh over 230lbs and it worked for me. I hope this helps!
1.0,"As far as I know it has worked. I had a slip up where the condoms may have let some sperm out so wanting to be safe my partner and I went to get the pill. About 6 days after I took the pill I started bleeding, which it didn’t stop for maybe like 10 days. This is not the time my period was supposed to come either. I started bleeding around my ovulation day but it wasn’t implantation bleeding. Started off dark brown then red then brown and then it started fading out. Now I have a really weird thick tissue like discharge inside of me. I’m pretty sure I’m not pregnant but the side effects suck cause it feels like my body has lost its balance."
1.0,"Before I begin, it worked, I'm not pregnant. I've taken Take Action and Plan B a couple of times (I’m a very paranoid person). I am writing this review now because I took Take Action, but this time was a lot different then any other time i’ve taken it. I took it a couple days after my period (last period ended Dec 15th), and I also took it 35 hours after the condom broke, on December 17th. most of the month was normal, I had spotting for 3 days starting on day 10 after the pill, which I wasn’t too worried about cuz that’s when I usually spot on Take Action/Plan B, usually Take Action would make me about a week late. I wasn’t concerned until after it was 7 days late and nothing. I took 2 pregnancy tests, both negative, told my strict mom about it even cuz I was so worried. I had a lot of bloating and slight cramps around this time. Yesterday, Jan 17th I got my period, with bad cramps. It works, but this pill is very irregular in the way it works."

I had a miscarriage December 5th."
1.0,It works if you  take within 24 hours. I took it within 20 hours and it worked. Don’t worry it’s on it’ll work.  I  stressed for 2 weeks and I  got my period today - just know it’s ok.
1.0,"DON'T FREAK OUT. I don’t know what it is but the side effects are worse on this pill. I know it’s the same ingredients but there’s something about it. Discharge, spotting, cramps, headaches all of the above and my spotting lasted for almost a month. But at last my period came. AND YOURS WILL TOO. You will be okay.  ❤️"
1.0,"Pill was taken 13 hours after he ""accidentally"" went inside. It was about 4 days after ovulation. I'm about 170 lbs, so I was a little concerned that it wouldn't work due to my weight, but it worked. My cycle was due 9 days after the incident but was 1 week late. I did have some symptoms for a few weeks after taking they were nausea, breast tenderness, moodiness and consistent cramps. Now that I have my period, I'm experiencing more than usual cramping and a little heavier flow. Despite the many symptoms, the pill worked."
0.0,I have been taking this for almost 2 weeks and after reading the reviews I'm terrified to keep taking it. My boobs have been really sensitive and I've been having a lot of back pain and I already have back problems. Plus I have severe anxiety and depression and it has been much worse since I started Isibloom. Starting to think maybe I should have just gotten fixed all the way around to avoid all of this. But I have a baby that's a little over 2 months old and he is all about mama and if I get fixed I won't be able to lift him for a while. Not sure what to do.
1.0,"I’ve been using Isbloom for 2 years now. Ever since the packaging was green and now a bold pink! I have not had any negative symptoms that’s caught my attention whatsoever! In fact it has cleared up my acne and got my period on schedule! Truly it depends on every person. It doesn’t hurt to try it, if it doesn’t work out move on to the next option!"
1.0,"I started using Isibloom early Marchin preparation for IVF . By week 1 I started feeling bloated. By week 2, my anxiety started increasing significantly. I cried almost every day. I was also extremely sleepy all the time. After about 17 days of usage I stopped taking the pill as suggested by the IVF schedule. My anxiety was through the roof, the following day, I thought I was going crazy. 2 days after stopping the pill, I woke up at 4:00am in a massive panic attack. I was sweating, I couldn’t think straight, I couldn’t plan. I felt crazy, mentally tormented. Then later that day I started my periods. The cramping was more violent than usual but I was bleeding less. A few days into my periods I kept feeling sleepy and unmotivated. Once my period stopped, about 1 week after stopping the pill, I felt normal."
1.0,"I have been on two different birth controls, Isibloom and Yaz, over the past three years. I think I have the opposite experience from most people. I first started taking Isibloom in the green package, but I still experienced a lot of horrible pain and mood swings and had been diagnosed with PMDD. Although there are so many problems with Yaz, I trusted my doctor and others in my family with PMDD when they said that was the best option. It was great until I had breakthrough periods that were so horrible I couldn’t even stand up without passing out, almost as bad as before I was on any birth control. Then I told my doctor about it and we went back to Isibloom for some reason (I think he forgot I was on it the first time and I didn’t notice until I picked it up from the pharmacy) but it was in pink packaging. If I take it consistently like I’m supposed to, I rarely get a period (the whole point of me being on continuous cycle is to prevent the period) and no side effects."
1.0,"I’ve been on this pill it seems like forever. One year, I renewed my prescription and that’s when I started seeing a change. At first, everything was fine. For about a year or so, I was getting regular 5-6 days of bleeding. Cramps only on the first day. Nothing else serious or major. Maybe slight mood swings but that’s it. 
Then, I renewed my prescription and for some reason (IDK if they changed the pill) but everything slowly started getting worse. Acne on my face came back after trying to fight it off for years. My cramps went from one day to many days before I started and days during my period. My period lasts for only 2-3 days. Mood swings are abnormal. I’m crying when I don’t want to cry. My energy is drained before my period starts. It’s hard to concentrate as well. I didn’t get much weight gain while on it but I have gained some weight. That’s about it."
1.0,"I first started using this birth control December 2021 and it was great when I first using it. There wasn't any negative effects showing at the time, helped me track my period, and saved me many times while being active lol. January 2022 I've been experiencing the worst mood swings ever just crying over nothing, and it impacted my sex life tremendously. I was not naturally getting wet which was uncommon and it was painful during sex. I talked to my doctor about it and she said it was alright and it was part of side effects but I just couldn't over the fact I wasn't naturally doing something I normally do. When I ran out of pills for about a week and I notice when I started taking the pills again then pain happened again during sex and sometimes not naturally getting wet. I recently just stop taking the pill overall because it was just messing up my sex life, health, and mental."
0.0,"I was on this pill for two months, not relating my issues to it. I was on my period for 6 months straight, gained 33lbs, acne breakouts, literally everything you don’t want. I finally went to the gyno and he said they stopped prescribing this pill over 20 years ago  because of the severe side effects (I got it through pill club since it was free). On top of everything I was experiencing, it has a long list of side effects, such as blood clots in the legs. Do not recommend."
1.0,"I am debating going off this birth control because I am not sure if it is the cause of some of my mental issues. I find myself occasionally having extreme mood swings, intense depression and anxiety for certain weeks of taking the pill. It doesn't happen every month - some months I have zero side effects. It did seem to completely get rid of my hormonal jaw acne which was nice. It also made my period shorter and less heavy. However, it has caused me to sweat way more, slightly more migraines, and didn't help period cramps at all. Also, if I take this pill more than 2 hours later than my scheduled time, I always will have heavy breakthrough bleeding for at least a week. Not sure it's right for me with history of mental illness but if you don't struggle with mental illness it may be right for you."
0.0,"I started using birth control through the Pill Club and was originally prescribed Cyred Eq, which works wonders for me, but then my orders of it were replaced with Isibloom, which apparently is the generic version. Within days I started spotting dark blood and noticed other changes. My breasts were so swollen my bras didn’t fit, I experienced horrible headaches and joint pains, I was irritable, moody, and so unbelievably anxious and paranoid. I constantly felt on edge and even had suicidal thoughts. If you have a history of mental illness, DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION. It amplified my anxiety and BPD times 10. Isibloom has been a nightmare"
0.0,"I've been taking Isibloom for about 2 and 1/2 months and after today I kind of put two and two together and realized I'm having a lot of symptoms from this birth control.  I have been overly emotional and could cry at the drop of a hat, I'm more irritable and aggressive, I'm having hot flashes, I'm getting bad headaches and migraines which I haven't had a migraine in almost a year and I'm also having a harder time reaching in orgasm and am not getting wet.  Today I broke down hysterical at work and had to leave early! My boyfriend and my mom had a talk about what's been going on with me and they both came to the conclusion that they think it's the birth control, so I just sat down and looked up the side effects and this is definitely the problem and I need to get on something different ASAP! But please do remember everybody is different!!"
0.0,"My doc prescribed this for period cramps. I wasn't able to finish the first month because it made me so incredibly depressed. Doc said it probably would have gotten better if I'd kept with it longer but it was really scary. My roommate was legit worried to let me out of sight for a while. Can't speak to the effectiveness for treating cramps as I didn't take it long enough. I also had some chest pain for a few days and decreased libido. Didn't have any acne when I was taking it though, so that was nice."
1,Those who haven't gained weight while taking this are lucky. I've been taking Ortho Tri Cyclen for three months and have gained 10 lbs! I'm going in to my dr to switch .
0,"It did its job- prevent pregnancy. The side effects that came with not being pregnant, however, was not worth it . It immensely affected my mood which in turn affected my relationship. I also gained about 10 lbs which affected my mental health as I already had body image and self esteem issues. Overall, I don't think its worth it."
1.0,"Okay, so I’m writing this review because I’ve used Aftera and Plan B before with varying levels of success and different scenarios each time. Typically, I take EC after my spouse and I make a mistake and he ejaculates inside during a fertile window. I’ve had 2 pregnancies, both times I’d taken EC within 24 hours but I was likely ovulating already and thus, it didn’t work because the deed was already done. On countless other times we would be 4-5 days pre ovulation and everything works out just fine."
1.0,"I first used Aftera after a drunken hookup. I’m not on bc and the condom broke. The guy wasn’t even close to finishing but I was still worried about precum so I took this EC the next day, within 12 hours. The next week I had tight abdominal pain and some cramping but nothing too bad. I know the pill can cause spotting about a week after but I actually ended up getting what I assume to be a full, 6 day long period 2 weeks earlier than I was expecting. About 2 weeks later I had another hookup with a different guy and the condom broke again only this time he had said he fully finished and I didn’t realize there was a hole until inspecting the condom afterwards. I picked up Aftera once again and took it within 12 hours of the sex. I had mild cramping again and currently experiencing what I’m hoping is only really bad PMS. Both times I was about 5 days from predicted ovulation. Fingers crossed it worked again expecting my period next week"
1.0,"I promised I would write a review if this product worked. So here goes: I just had a baby 2 months ago and absolute don’t want to be pregnant again. My husband and I are very fertile. I have had 7 pregnancies in 5 years with 3 live births. And I got pregnant on the first try each time and even while on birth control. According to my doctors I’m a freak of nature. So when we had an oopsie 3 days before ovulation I panicked. I was at my most fertile, with the egg white discharge. I took aftera the next day and just prayed for the next few days that I wouldn’t get pregnant. I am amazed at the product and it really worked. I had no side effects and I looked really hard for them. My period came one week early. Actually was a bonus because I was nervous wreck and couldn’t take the suspense for long. I am currently experiencing very heavy bleeding. I have never had a heavy period in my life so this was a shock but hey I’m not complaining!"
0.0,Took it as directed. I’m 37 weeks pregnant now . I took Plan B twice before and never had any issues. Accepted my blessing but know that 10 dollars does make a difference. Buy the Plan B not Aftera
1.0,I wanted to write a review because reading reviews was the only thing that helped me relax while waiting for my period. I took Aftera 15 days ago after having unprotected sex. He completed finished inside of me twice and this was 2-3 days before ovulation. I waited 40 hours before I took the pill because I had a big work day the day after the incident and I remember that I always have had terrible side effects with morning after pills. But I wouldn’t suggest that!  Take the pill right away!! And man o man the side effects are terrible for me. I swore I was pregnant. I was dizzy off and on with nausea for the past two weeks. My boobs were huge and I had cramping pretty much since I took the pill. The cramping was not like normal period cramps which made me nervous because I was worried for implantation cramping. Part of me was so worried I was pregnant. But my period came one day before it was supposed to and I feel so relieved. Try to hang in there! Let’s try n practice safe sex!
1.0,"First off, breathe! You’ll be okay sweet girl! Don’t google too many things you’re gonna stress yourself out. 
I used Aftera about 8 hours after the condom broke and (I’m pretty sure) he finished in me. I was supposed to get my period in a week and this was AFTER I ovulated! So I took the pill, it gave me headaches and mild cramps. My discharge was kinda watery and there was more than usual. I swore it was gonna mess up my cycle and my period would be pushed back a week BUT!!!! I got my full period today, ON TIME!!! Literally perfect timing, I usually track my periods and I’m very regular! 
So for me Aftera worked after my ovulation (a week before my period) and didn’t mess up my cycle! I hope this gives you some relief!"
1.0,"I promised myself that if it worked I would come back and write review since these reviews kept me sane while waiting. Thankfully, it did and I'm not pregnant. I had unprotected sex the day after my ovulation day. I freaked out and bought an Aftera about 5 hours later and took it immediately.  The side effects can best be described as intense pre-menstrual symptoms. My breast were swollen and extremely sore for 2 weeks until my period. I had nausea, fatigue but not much discharge. My period came right when it was suppose too, and was paired with heavy bleeding for five days . I'm writing this to reassure many other women going through this. The side effects are similar to pregnancy symptoms but that only means it's working. The side effects can be annoying and inconvenient, but in the end, the pill works and I'm sure many prefer this over a child. I hope all women reading this not only feel better knowing others have went through what you are but also that your period comes!!"
1.0,GIRLS PLEASE JUST TAKE A PLAN B. Aftera works but it messes you up bad. I’m 19 years old and I’ve had a regular period for many many years. I usually start the 25 or 26. My boyfriends condom broke and it was around my ovulation so we went to the store but there were no plan B’s so we just bought Aftera. About a week later I started bleeding for about 4 days and it was brown blood. This is also a sign of pregnancy so I was very scared. I also started getting weird discharge and I felt like I had period symptoms the entire time that I was waiting for my period. I didn’t get my period until the 7th!!!  I was late by 13 days and I was freaking out. I took 8 pregnancy tests and they were all negative of course but this pill messed up my entire body. Plan b has never done this so please just stick to what you know
1.0,"hi sweet girls, first I wanna start off by saying you will be okay! And you can get though this & you’re not alone! Sooo my bf & I had sex Feb 1st and I don’t know if the condom broke but he finished and i could feel it all on the outside of me. I had bought Aftera last month in case of emergencies so I took the pill about 8 hours after the deed. Note. I’m expecting my period in a week & I don’t know when I ovulated. Within 2 hours I had cramps & a headache but nothing terrible. I woke up with watery/runny clear discharge, so not sure what that’s about. It’ll be 3 days since I took Aftera & I’m feeling confident I’m not preggo.. but I will update whenever I get my period! please pray for me!"
1.0,"I had sex the day of ovulation. No birth control. He came inside me. I took the pill 23 hours later. My breast were beginning to become sore then when I took the pill it went away. I have no side effects. I'm sure the pill worked, but if it doesn't I'll come back and post."
0,"Started this pill the summer before I left for college. Worked amazing for the first half then all of sudden, I would get my cycle for 2 weeks at a time or I would get my cycle for the regular time and then I would get it again the next week. After I explained to my dr on campus and the prescribing dr they both told me since I was more concerned about clearing my life long acne that this would be best form of birth control for me. However once I stopped taking it, I literally stopped getting cycles while that saved me a ton of money. It messed with my ability to get pregnant & that in itself made me more depressed than I ever been. It’s been years since taking it and I now have 2 kids but I believe if I haven’t touched it or went to a different brand than my first baby would’ve been my 3rd or 4 th kid."
0,Terrible! I've only been on Nikki for a week and everyday I wake up with an AWFUL headache. I have literally gone through half a bottle of Tylenol in a week. I absolutely do not recommend this BC find anything else.
1,This birth control cured my cystic acne in one month.
1,So far so good. I started taking this medication two months ago for cystic acne and my skin is clear so it’s working perfectly for me. The only side effect I’ve noticed is worse than usual cramps but It’s 100% worth it to have clear skin.
1,"I have a mostly love / tiny bit of dislike  relationship with Nikki. I took it for 6 months and my acne was not only cleared but my skin was GLOWING. After 6 months though, I realized my libido wasn't quite what it used to be so I stopped taking it. After a few weeks libido was back to normal BUT I had started gaining weight and my acne came back with a vengeance. I just started taking it again after a few months off and I'm glad I did. Going to try to balance my libido with some supplements instead. 

Previously I've been on Reclipsen (which I loved, zero side effects) until they stopped manufacturing it, then had a Paragard for many years but my body kept forcing it out (too big). Everyone's different of course! Just my experience."
1,Started taking Nikki a little over 3 months for moderate acne. I do not see any improvement instead it has gotten worse. Not sure if I should continue taking it and will it ever get better !!
0,"This birth control at first decreased my appetite by a large comparison to previously used Junel 1/20. I tried this brand for the acne part, since I've seen dermatologists since I was 15 and nothing worked. Now almost 3 months into this brand, nothing has been done to clear my face, I sleep for entire days and am overcome with extreme tiredness. I get severe nausea and throw up at least 3 times a week, and I don't eat as much as I used to. I lost near 10 pounds in 2 months. A good thing was it stopped my painful period cramps and I haven't got a since period since taking the pill. A very slight increase in boob size, but still very tender breasts."
1,"I started Nikki just around 5 months ago and it works great for me! I began taking it for my extremely irregular periods and the more obvious reason. Since taking it, my acne has significantly cleared up and my period has become completely regular now, coming at the exact same time every month with minimal cramps. It's also free with my insurance. The only downsides are that I cry more easily now (although I've always been a sensitive person so that's pretty normal for me) and I have more frequent migraines, but I've always had migraines and I'm not sure if it's the pill that has caused that."
1,"hi guys, I just started Nikki, and I had no side affects whatsoever I feel great. I do not feel any different, but I've actually have a higher sex drive??? hahaha if you are afraid of trying this please don't.  I was scared to and I'm doing fine, but I guess it depends on everyones different bodies. OH one more thing, I think I'm losing weight with this!!!!!! Like gurrrrllll idk if I'm crazy but I'm literally weighting myself everyday now hahah."
0,"I have been on this Nikki birth control for about 2 and a half months.
I have tried numerous pills in the past which had not worked for me, so here I am almost a quarter of the way through my third pack. Not much has changed, in fact, it has gotten worse. The only thing it has changed is my periods which have become slighty lighter and shorter. 
I look forward to the day when this Nikki pill actually shows some changes to my face:)"
0,"I'm on my 2nd pack of Nikki birth control, so I'm about a month and a half in, and my skin has absolutely never looked worse than it does right now. My skin has always been pretty smooth for the most part with maybe some breakouts on my chin or forehead, but since I started Nikki, i've had terrible acne all over my face, sometimes even on my neck. I switched pharmacies and I believe that my new pharmacy doesn't have the generic form of Yaz that my other pharmacy carried, but the generic form of Yaz I was taking before Nikki never made my skin look this awful. I've also been feeling significantly more depressed and anxious recently, and I hadn't contributed that shift in mood to Nikki until I read other people on here saying that Nikki made them feel more depressed and anxious - now I'm suspicious! I've read some people on here say that Nikki didn't start helping their acne until around month three so I'm gonna wait another month or two and come back to update y'all."
0,"This pill was fine at first.. but it gave me so much anxiety after about a month. I don’t recommend this to anyone anymore. My depression has become so bad and the weight gain is out of control. i’ve never had this experience with birth control so I don’t recommend this to anyone that’s suffering with anxiety already. It is effective in the sense that it will prevent pregnancy, but the effects are ridiculous so please be safe if you use this!"
1,"As someone who has always struggled with severe hormonal acne that I’ve been able to tame with good skincare, diet, exercise etc, this helped so much in balancing my hormones and preventing hormonal breakouts. I didn’t gain any weight, but my breasts did get bigger and firmer. I used to get some bad cramps but I haven’t had any since starting Aubra, and my period is so much lighter now and was only about 4 days. Most importantly, I haven’t gotten pregnant. I got a few headaches when I first started and some mood swings, but it wasn’t anything crazy, so I’d say the side effects for me have been very minimal."
0,"I was never on any BC and decided to and they gave me Aubra, the first couple months I’d say we’re fine, then I started getting really bad mood swings. Mostly it just makes me a really angry person. My poor boyfriend haha. My period was also normal for the first couple months, then I just started bleeding nonstop, even if it was light. I also have gained weight, and I feel like no matter what I eat I'm still hungry. The only good thing I will say about this birth control, is no babies, and my skin is really clear."
0.0,"The first night I took this pill I thought I was going to die. I took it at 8 in the evening, then woke up at 2:30 AM with heart palpitations, an irregular pulse, nausea, shortness of breath, and feeling extremely weak. I’m done with this already."
0.0,"The prescribing provider asked how long I had depression and then said, I think Levora is the right fit… no talk of side effects, just asked what I didn’t want to have happen. I’m honestly thankful I survived this 3 week experience of this nightmare! I had the worst insomnia, constantly crying, zero regulation of mood. The rage, the pain, and the inability to feel like I was worthy of existence actually had me contemplating admitting myself to the psych ward. It was uncontrollable misery. I couldn't eat or focus. I thought all of this stemmed from relationship issues I am having and told my therapist it shouldn’t hurt THIS bad! When she found out I was prescribed Levora, she said it’s the equivalent of handing a suicidal person a weapon. If you have ever experienced a moment of depression, strongly do not recommend. Actually  for happy people, I still wouldn’t recommend. With what I felt, I hope no one has taken their life trying to seek prevention or regulation using Levora!"
1.0,"I used to have debilitating cramps to the point that I would have to call into work. Vomiting, diarrhea, flu-like symptoms the day I started my period. Now that is pretty much all gone. Every time I start my period it's a surprise because I don't even have cramps beforehand. My acne is better. The only negative side effect is I feel like I am much more emotional and flat out mean when I am PMSing and PMS seems to last a lot longer than it used to. I also gained 10 lb but that could totally just be my bad eating habits."
0.0,Took this pill for about 8 months before contacting my provider to change birth controls. I have taken many birth control pills and do not usually have any major issues.  The biggest issue I had with this pill was nausea. I took this pill before bed time in hopes of lessening the nausea. I would still get nauseous at night before bed.  I missed a pill one day and had to take 2 pills in one day. This resulted in me vomiting after the second pill was taken. This pill is not for me but it may be okay for you.
0.0,"I was previously on a BC that made me moody, my new Dr switched me to Alesse. My mood is better, but I put on SO much weight. It made me so depressed, I didn't know what was wrong with me, I felt gross all the time. Switched back less than 2 weeks ago. Feel less sick and lost a bunch of weight already, with nothing else changing. So now to find something that doesn't make me moody or fat lol"
0.0,"I began taking this medication after being on Diane35 for about 9 years, originally being put on it for acne. Diane was a perfect birth control pill for me, however due to the higher risk of blood clots my doctor and I decided I should try a new pill. I didn't experience spotting and my period was light on this medication, which was a plus. However, it reaked absolute havoc on my body. I haven't had acne for about 2-3 years now, and going on Alesse caused me to break out horrifically all over my face, on my shoulders and on my chest. The acne would start to go away only when I was on my week of sugar pills, and then come back a few days after starting the next pack. It also caused the worst mental health and mood issues I have ever experienced. I have never struggled with depression and only have mild anxiety. After going on this pill, my anxiety has become unmanageable and any inconvenience makes me want to cry and sink into a hole. I am almost in a state of being nonfunctional now."
1,"I’ve been on Cryselle for 11 years now and my body has tolerated it really well. Didn’t plan on being on birth control for this long but I haven’t had really any negative side effects that make me want to get off of it at this time. My periods are light and consistent, I have no acne, no weight gain, my energy levels are consistently high. The only thing I would say is negative is I do get pretty severe PMS the week before my period, but I try to drink plenty of water, eat lots of veggies, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and get plenty of sleep to limit the symptoms. I would be open minded to trying this BCP if you haven’t found a pill that has worked for you yet!"
0,"Cryselle is the second birth control pill I’ve tried. I switched after my previous pill gave me horrible skin issues and facial breakouts. While Cryselle did clear up my skin and get it back to normal, it caused weight gain, extreme fatigue, loss of motivation, and my hair (normally very curly) changed texture (much less curly, dull, and lifeless). It did relieve period pain and made my cycle very predictable though. All in all, I’m much happier not using it, but the pill is all about finding the perfect one for your own body. Cryselle was not the one for me."
1,"I was scared to use birth control because of all the taboos that come with being a Christian. I am a newly wed and don't plan on having kids till 1-2 more years which is why I decided to get on it. I was prescribed this one then lutera and now back to Sronyx. In all honestly, I have not felt anything with Sronyx but Lutera did make me cranky which is the only thing I will say is bad. My hair has actually grown although I am breaking out more than usual but nothing I can't handle. I have suffered from depression and anxiety previously but BC has not had a large effect on that as I have been able to control it. Don't be scared to try something because of others bad experience. You will have to live it yourself in order to understand if something works for you or not."
0,I have been taking Sronyx for about 3 or 4 months now  andI have constant nausea and/ or feeling of cramping even when not on my period. When I did get my period I passed a blood clot that was larger then a quarter it gives me back pain that I am not used to experiencing until taking this pill.  I guess the positive would be it is pretty good with preventing pregnancy just has way to many negative side effects for me
0.0,"I took Mili as prescribed to regulate my hormones due to PCOS and it caused me to lose 30 lbs in 4 months, made my hair thin and brittle, worsened depression, worsened anxiety, caused my feet and armpits to smell terrible (and that's never been a problem for me) lowered appetite, made me more angry, and completely demolished my libido.
It did however regulate my period so I didn't menstruate for 3 months straight, and it helped with unwanted hair growth."
0.0,I took this medicine for a few months and had the WORST anxiety I have ever had - and I never had anxiety before taking this. It also made me extremely nauseous and feel like I was going to faint all the time. I wouldn’t recommend this medication to ANYONE. I’ve been off for 3 weeks and I am slowly starting to feel like myself again.
0.0,First birth control I ever started and before I never had trouble with terrible cramping just mild cramping on the first day and I only got on this birth control to regulate my periods. At first It was great there was no effects then a week after taking it I started noticing spotting and that lasted for a week then I got on my period this has to be the worse pain I’ve ever felt in my life and no pain pills help I’ve tried ibuprofen 800 and naproxen 500. If this is your first time on birth control and this is the pill your prescribed just be prepared for unbearable cramps day and night.

0.0,"I started Mili about 4-5 months ago. It has been the worst months of my life. I used to be on Previfem for 5 years and they discontinued and switched me to Mili. I have always had slight anxiety but have never been truly depressed before until now. I had no idea it was related to the pill but my boyfriend noticed that I had been acting differently and so he found my BC and googled it and told me that it had really bad reviews with people often complaining about being irritable, anxious and depressed. I was having trouble getting out of bed in the morning and was not able to get excited or happy about ANYTHING! I then realized that on my off week when I have my period, I feel great and back to normal (because I am not receiving the dose of hormones that week). I finally made the connection after reading the reviews and called my pharmacist today to switch me to something else."
0.0,"I unlike others haven’t experienced mood swings with this or severe weight gain or horrible acne but it has increased my break outs. However, this is the worst thing I’ve ever been in my life. I started BC years ago for my cramps but have changed over the years cause they stop working for my cramps. I was put on this and I get my period every other week and on top of that my cramps are worse then they were before I was even on BC. I literally cry from pain and can’t move and sleep all day."
0.0,"I thought I loved this birth control at first because it cleared up my acne and for the first time in my life I had regular periods. A few months after starting it I became the most irrational, depressed person but I didn’t realize it had anything to do with the pill at the time. I truly felt like I was going absolutely insane. Every day I’d wish I didn’t have to live my life and I’d cry hysterically over the most random issues and didn’t understand why. I finally realized that I started feeling bad after starting the pill so I stopped taking it just to see. Within just a couple of weeks I felt like so much weight was lifted off my chest and I could finally breathe again. I feel completely back to normal after being off of it for a couple months. Feeling the way that I felt was truly so scary and I don’t like to think about what might have happened if i stayed on it much longer. It was the most awful thing for my mental health."
1.0,"I just finished my first cycle on Mili. I have always experience irregular periods and  recently started getting bad acne on my back and arms. Mili was the first time I was able to predict my period, which was awesome! My acne started to go away, or overall I felt fine- just cramping the first few days.

My period on Mili is a different story. The first day of my period was uncomfortable but manageable. The second day I felt fine until around dinner, when my stomach really started to cramp. Took some advil and called it a night. The THIRD DAY was the worst 
I've ever had my period. Around 3:00 after feeling fine all day I break into a random cold sweat, start getting shaky, and barely made it to the bathroom to vomit. My 30 minute drive home I was praying I wouldn't crash as my nausea was intense and my stomach felt like I had hot coals in there.

The rest of my period was touch-and-go, some days better than the other but never as bad as 3rd day. I'm giving it one more cycle."
0.0,"I was given Mili as a one-month substitute for my regular birth control Estrylla and was told it works the same. Unfortunately it was everything but. For almost the entire month, I’ve felt extremely emotional, moody, fatigued and sore. I usually struggle with acne in mild bursts around my period but I haven’t had so many breakouts in years since starting it… I thought I was going crazy but then I remembered I was taking something different."
0.0,"I made an account just to make sure to share this- this pill is garbage. I started taking it for ovarian cysts, and was originally prescribed Sprintec, but I was given Mili instead. This is my first time on birth control and I've been on Mili for 4 months now.

It gives me horrible heartburn (which I've never had), and the weirdest side effect is pelvic/vaginal soreness when I restart the pack every month. It causes mild burning and just an off feeling. It's not excruciating, but definitely present. I've had so many doctors tell me this isn't a side effect of birth control- but the consistency and timing of these symptoms suggest otherwise. I am negative for any kind of infection. It's just the effect it has on me at the beginning of the month. 

I've also experienced: cramping, heavier periods, extreme breast tenderness, dizziness, extreme hunger, and I am tired all the time. I can sleep for 13 hours straight and wake up tired."
1.0,I like taking Mili it helps me alot. Plus I have no problem gaining weight. Also it clears my face. I have had mood swings but thats about it. Other than that no other side effects. I just started taking this last month in beginning of January 2022. So far I'm enjoying taking them. I hope it stays that way I'm willing to gain pounds that doesn't bother me.
0.0,"I've been on Spintec for about 4 years, never had one issue or side affect. CVS gave me Milli instead, assured me it was the exact same as Sprintec. The first day I took it I vomited until there was nothing left in my stomach and then some. The next few days I went through the worst nausea I've experienced in my life. 24/7 feeling like I could throw up at any moment. On day 4 of Milli I almost went to the hospital with severe abdominal pain, I couldn't move or breathe. This was the worst pain I've ever experienced & I have a high pain tolerance. Who knows what would have happened if I kept taking this pill.. When I called CVS to tell them about my reaction they argued with me and said there is no reason at all this pill should affect me like this. She said it is the EXACT same as Sprintec, she almost made me second guess myself making me feel absurd. But I know my body and a couple days after not taking it I am perfectly fine. Please, please, beware of this product."
1.0,I used to take Sprintec for about 4 years before I switched to Mili and honestly I have not felt any change at all so 10 for me!
0.0,"My doctor prescribed Mili because my anxiety and pms (anger) issues get really bad with my periods. I was supposed to take Mili nonstop and just skip the placebo week so that I wouldn't have periods. About my 3rd month of taking Mili I started my period. I had heavy bleeding for 2 weeks. Called the Dr and they told me to take 800 mg of ibuprofen every 8 hrs (that's a lot for me I normally only take the 200 mg tablets when I'm really hurting) so I did this and the bleeding lessened but never stopped. I stopped taking Mili (on my own) but the Dr. also recommended it. So I had 2 weeks of heavy bleeding on Mili, 3 days of spotting, and now I'm on my period again. Hopefully it stops soon. I'm very frustrated with this whole experience. I took Sprintec a couple years ago and my insurance changed my pill. I started having suicidal thoughts. I'm not 100% sure which pill that was, but needless to say I was already weary about trying birth control again."
0.0,I been on it for about 5 months and had to stop periods due to anemia. But when on it I have bleeding still so then I have to take progesterone as well. So  what’s the point
0.0,"It’s the worst I have ever taken in 25 years.  Migraines, acne, emotional, and fatigue!  Mili makes me so Sick !"
1.0,"I don't know why everyone has bad experiences or bad things to say about this. I have had no side affects with this birth control, and it's cleared my acne. I'd give a 20/10 if I could."
1.0,"I started Mili about 2 months before I got married. My mood was effected immediately. I became very sad and anxious. I also began to gain weight very quickly. Nothing in my diet had changed, in fact I was eating healthier  than normal. Overall I just didn’t like how it made my body feel. The only plus was my periods were regular. And I didn’t spot when I started it."
0.0,"I had Mirena 3 times and decided to switch, one because I didn’t want to be on anything (hormones are horrible for your body period) & two cause I just wanted to see if anything was different without it. I’ve been using Mirena for almost 15 years & they say you notice changes when you stop something. Mirena was amazing. That’s what I’ve discovered. Should have never had it removed. Anyways- they prescribed me Tri Lo Mili (didn’t want my skin in shock seeing as I’m doing bodywork right now) I’m two weeks in to this pill & the side effects I am experiencing so far are- first week-insomnia/ high anxiety, night sweats (so gross) mainly in my legs, bleeding gums (never had in my life), absolutely zero appetite what so ever (and I’m a daily chocolate kind of gal)…"
1,"I am 30 have been on this birth control since I was 22. I LOVE this birth control. When I first had to get on birth control, I went through three or four before I found this one that finally worked for me. Mood-wise I feel completely level, and I have never gained weight, never had an oops pregnancy, and never had acne on this pill. I will say that I started having break through bleeding and some out of the ordinary acne over the past year but my gyno said that's just because I have been on it so long that its time to phase out for a new one. I am super sad to let this one go but if your doctor recommends, it is definitely worth a try."
0,This birth control SUCKS. Mind you I’ve only been on it for a couple of months now. I have a very good complexion & out of absolutely no where I have breakouts and cystic acne. My mood swings have been miserable. I'm either crying or angry which is completely unlike me. I also have zero sex drive. do not take this pill. Worst birth control I’ve ever taken.
1,"Been taking Portia for three years now. It was so much better than the first birth control I was taking, but now that I’m 25 my body feels like it’s changed and Portia is affecting me in nasty ways. My ability to loose weight is out the window, I’ve been getting hormonal acne and my mood has been a roller coaster for months now. When I started at 21 it was amazing. No bloat, clear skin, no nausea. But now I’m older, I can’t stand taking this pill. Recommend it for younger women, but no one over 25 :/"
0,"This birth control was very difficult for me. Made me extremely moody, sensitive made my depression and anxiety worse. This medication caused suicidal ideation within the first week and a half. if you are trying this birth control please monitor mood and symptoms closely."
1,Made me question living. I stopped taking bc my depression got bad then started again and it came back. My boobs also got bigger :(
0,"I've missed 5 days of school because it makes me sick. i didn’t realize it was the birth control at first but I'd feel okay all day but after I took it at night I got sick, puked, couldn’t sleep, felt nauseous etc. I puked up my dinner multiple times in a row after I took it, I tried taking it a little later but it didn’t help anything. Through out the day I’m ok but I get the feeling like I’m gonna puke like I do at night and have to take a break and try to eat which is hard because every time I eat I feel sick. I’ve only been on this brand for about a week in a half. I also am starting to break out a lot more than I usually would on other birth controls."
0,"I was healthy 30 year old female with no other possible health factors. I had been on Ocella for about a year and a half. The Monday after my daughter’s third birthday, I started having intense shoulder/AC joint pain. I went to two chiropractors and talked to three doctors. By Thursday, I was driving to get an X-ray when I felt like I was having a heart attack. I went closest ER and after an EKG, blood work, and CT Angio, was told I had two Pulmonary Embolism’s with infarcts. I was hospitalized for two and a half days and on blood thinners for three months. ALWAYS be your own advocate!"
1,"I think this birth control is okay. It makes me really moody sometimes especially on my period I only get nauseous, heavy bleeding, headaches and cramps but other then that it’s not bad I have gained plenty of weight being on it and I get paranoid ONLY on my period. It seems impossible to get off the weight but it could be because I’ve been on pills for 5 1/2 years straight to make sure it’s a better chance I don’t have a child. When not on my period I get really sad sometimes for no reason at all."
0,I have only been on Loryna a month. Please avoid taking this birth control. I took one month and can't take it . I thought I was going crazy I don't even recognize my own house. I have severe anxiety to the point where I'm crying all day. And on top of it I'm having symptoms of IBS that I hope clear up cause I just can't deal with that. The stomach problems are so bad I've lost 15 pounds in less than a week cause of the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms.  I'm just hoping I can clear all this up please pray for me. I stopped taking the pills it has only been a day I just hope I can recover from the negative side effects this pill has caused. Correction I will recover its going to take time but I will get through this. AVOID LORYNA  at all cost and any birth control that contains that synthetic hormones drospirenone.
1,As I read through the comments I want to remind everyone that we all have different bodies. Personally I have a high level of hormones and tend to break out often. I have tried multiple brands and have had pretty bad symptoms. I tried this brand and like all BC the first few weeks I had symptoms especially nausea as my body was getting adjusted. I’ve been taking this brand for about 2 years and now have beautiful skin and short/ less painful periods. If you have similar issues as I did I would highly recommend giving this brand a try. Hope this was helpful for other women who suffered from acne and elevated hormone levels.
1,"I see so many negative reviews for Loryna but I thought I would write a positive one because there's probably a girl out there who was just like me and scared to death to switch birth controls because of all the horrid reviews. I took generic Ortho Tri Cyclen (Trinessa) for several years because I have acne alongside my need for BC. Ortho made me into a lunatic. It ramped up my emotions to the point of me damn near becoming psychotic. When I gave birth to my daughters I tried the Copper IUD, had it almost 3 years but got sick of the CONSTANT bleeding I was having. decided to get back on Ortho Tri Cyclen (this time called Tri-Lo-Mili) and immediately became a raging psychopath after only a few days of taking it. Now granted, I would've stuck it out, but I remembered how I was during the 3 years of Trinessa and the feelings were the exact same. I switched to Loryna and the first day there was immediate mental relief. I've had 0 negative side effects. Love this BC so much."
0,"I'm on day 5 of Loryna and I am so suicidal I considered going to the hospital. I was trying it for PMDD, I did have success before on Lo Loestrin FE but I was having side effects of melasma and low libido so I wanted to try something else. This is awful. I've also had nightmares and nausea since starting it."
1,"I have been on Loryna for about 9 months now. I have PCOS and struggled with heavy periods (sometimes twice a month), horrible cramps, mood swings and acne. Since starting Loryna I'm now able to skip my periods all together getting rid of almost all my negative side effects (still get pretty emotional around the time my period would come). I did gain about 10 lbs and my motivation to workout is almost pretty low. I used to go to the gym 5 days a week and eat healthy. I now crave unhealthy foods more and dread the gym. Maybe this is just an excuse lol but I had to stop for about two weeks due to my prescription being shipped to a previous address and immediately my motivation to workout and eat healthy came back. 

But back to a positive note: my skin has never been clearer and I would recommend this birth control to a friend in a heart beat."
0,"I’ve been on BC before but had issues with depression. I tried Loryna and am 2 months in and can’t take it anymore! I have had headaches, probably gained weight, increased hunger, depression worse than I’ve ever experienced- crying over absolutely nothing off and on the first month then it stopped for a few weeks and it’s back worse than ever with intense mood swings! I have had brain fog, fatigue, and the mood swings/irritability that happened in the 2nd month have affected my life and relationships! 
I feel unable to control my emotions and I’m sure I seem crazy to the guy I recently started seeing! I hope this pill hasn’t ruined my relationship but I know it’s made me a crying, irritated, bloated lunatic! I’ve worked hard to be an easy going, emotionally stable adult but this pill makes me feel like I’m 2 sheets to the wind ugly crying and angry like I’m on a whisky bender. I don’t even drink anymore. I do not recommend!"
0,Makes me feel very very moody. Lots of crying and feeling unhappy. I’ve been on it over a year and it’s time to change because this one isn’t making me feel good at all.
1,"Loryna was the first-ever birth control I've ever taken and I've been using it for around five months. At first, I had nausea spells and my boobs were really tender but that went away within the first month or so. Before taking it, I had the worst cramps imaginable and there was never a time where my skin was clear. Since taking it, my periods are light, I don't cramp at all, my skin has cleared up tremendously (still breaking out on chin/cheeks a bit but that could be from me wearing a mask at school/work/etc. ) and my boobs actually went up a cup size. The reason I'm actually switching to another pill though is because of my mood swings and the weight gain. I have been extra irritable and sensitive to the point where IDK how I acted before the pill and since taking the pill, I've gained 15 pounds. I am scared of switching since Loryna was good for me, but I want to see if there is a pill that will help my mood, clear my skin up more, and get myself back to my regular weight."
1,"Loryna has been the only bc that works for me. I have switched and had multiple issues with other medicines, and always switched back to loryna. These low reviews did not sit true with me.  It’s been great for me!"
1,It’s been over 5 years since I’ve been on Errin and I’ve seen a change in my weight.  I got off the pill for 6 months dropped the weight got back on it and came right back. Love the product but I can’t keep this weight I’ve done everything
0,"As much as I wanted to love Errin, this was definitely NOT for me. I have never been any lower mentally nor experienced so many mood swings all at once. I started taking this birth control the beginning of March, so for a month it really just changed my appearance and mental health. Now I have acne all over my face and it was never as bad as this. Also, I am gaining weight fast too, and I barely even eat. I just do not feel like myself so if you have anxiety or depression I would not recommend this birth control. I take .35 mg everyday so maybe it is the dosage and its too much but either way I will not be continuing this pill"
1,"6 years and my bleeding has finally stopped! I have been severely anemic due to massive bleeding since I was about 16ish.
I have had to get multiple transfusions and been hospitalized over and over. Until my Dr suggested Errin! My cbc labs are FINALLY fixing and I am no longer freezing 24/7. It feels awesome after 20 years of the same mess and no real answers."
0,"I’ve been using this pill for a while now (a year+) and my period has never ever been so irregular. I went 9 months without a period. No I wasn’t pregnant it just happened to be that amount of time. Then I went 6 months without one, again I wasn’t pregnant. I got my period in December then January, around the same time. I haven’t gotten it again since in February and I know it isn’t pregnancy because I have zero symptoms and my boyfriend and I are long distance. I’m just tired of the inconsistency. I have the worst cramps I’ve ever experienced. I’ve gained 30lbs and can’t loose the weight. I switched to Errin from my original because it was giving me migraines and putting me at a higher risk of a stroke at my age (16/17 at the time I am now 19). I think now that I just have chronic migraines, but this birth control is not one I would recommend."
0,"Been on for about 6 months due to having a blood clot possibly from estrogen BC; hence the progesterone.
I started on a higher dose of norethindrone and ended up going here because the side effects were terrible; they are better on this pill but still present (currently on .35mg)
I've had breast leakage, breast pain/tenderness (all the time), clots on periods, somewhat irregular periods in terms of time.

I will say my nausea hasn't been bad on this pill, and my pelvic endometriosis symptoms have lessened (not so much my bowel or upper abdominal), but I really don't like the breast pain. It's unbearable for me but I'm hoping to last until March after my endo surgery to get off it."
0,p>		“Been taking this birthcontrol for 4 month's and have been having two periods a month. I have PCOS and having two periods a month with only two weeks apart to one week apart is causing me a lot of pain. When I had my second period on this pill I was filling a big pad in a hour. DO NOT TAKE THIS PILL!!!!. I'm going to go on another birth control or just stop all together.”</p
1,"I like this pill for the most part! I am taking it for many things but mainly acne, it cleared up in a month! I have a lighter period and no cramps. The first period on it was irregular because my body had to get used to the hormones. It’s effective in protection, and also helped with PMS. One thing I will say is that I struggled with nausea and food aversions to things I really used to love, but other than that I like it :)"
1,"Been on beyaz for 3 years now and it’s been amazing. My skin has completely cleared up to the point where I have no acne and my period has gotten a lot lighter and only last 3 days in total now. The only negative side effect I’ve seen is my sex drive and overall ability to stay wet has decreased a lot. But if you’re only looking for a birth control mainly for your skin, this is the best one!"
1,"One of the better experiences with birth control I've had. Granted, I still experienced side effects like some mood swings in the beginning (nothing too severe) and nausea, possibly some related constipation.  However, it kept my PMDD symptoms confined to shorter periods of time (a day or two every month or so, as opposed to 3-5 days every month). Breakthrough bleeding was a problem on it after a while, but that could be related to skipping placebos. Compared to other birth control pills I've been on which have sent me into manic/depressive cycles, this has been the best for my body. For comparison, I don't do well with any birth control pills containing northindrone."
0,I'm on day three of the pill and I never ever get nausea for the past 45  minutes I have not been able to move due to the fear that I will throw up all over my dorm floor.
0,"A year ago my doctor prescribed this BC to help with my cystic acne, after reading all of poor the reviews online I never ended up taking it. Fast forward to now, I'd had enough of the acne & my doctor highly suggested I give this pill a try, and not read anything online. So I tried the pill for 3 days, and immediately knew I had to stop. The depression was HEAVY, extremely noticeable being someone who used to be depressed and is currently in a good place. For reference I run a business which I am very passionate about and I literally felt the urge to walk away from it all. For the first time ever I actually really didn't like my job at all, I could barely get myself to open the store. I knew right away that it wasn't worth it. I hate to feed the fire, or to keep anyone from taking this whom it might help, but I can strongly back up all of the reviews that have mentioned depression because it is very real and can make you feel very lost overnight."
0,"I was on Lo Loestrin but had to be switched to Tri-Lo-Sprintec (have also taken Tri-Lo-Marzia, both of which are supposed to be the generic brands) because apparently no insurance companies cover Lo Lo anymore. I have been experiencing very red, blotchy and big pimples near my chin, jawline and cheeks. I am 20 years old and have experienced acne but never to this extent. I thought it was just me and saw a dermatologist, went on Clindamycin and Tretinoin but those aren't helping. Finally decided it was time to make an appt with my Gyno and try to find something else that works for me. It has not affected my sex drive but I do experience vaginal dryness at times. I was being told that the acne was from what I eat, but I eat relatively healthy and work out 3-4 times a week. Would not recommend this pill to anyone. Even if they say it is generic for Lo Loestrin, I wouldn't try it, and if you do-- don't wait as long as I did to realize that new, persistent acne is most likely from this pill."
0,"Please do your research before taking this pill. I have been taking Tri-Sprintec for years, no issues. My pharmacy switched my prescription to this and I didn’t think to do any research before taking it. After 3 days on the pill, I started having extreme depression and suicidal thoughts. I’m normally a very happy, driven individual and this pill crippled all drive I had for life. I stopped taking it after 3 days and hoping it leaves the system ASAP."
0,"This was the first birth control I was put on and it was primarily for the use of birth control but also for bad hormonal acne (I am talking those teenage years where you have so many different face washes and nothings working and you don't do any activity but some how 30 minutes after washing your face you are an greasy mess). It definitely help with my acne, that cleared up completely to the point I could literally almost sleep with makeup on and there would be nothing on my face. I also swear I lost weight on this birth control. The downside though, for my the third week with the changes in drug ratio I would get EXTREMELY depressed, like it wasn't great at all. I spent most of my emotional time on this pill balancing between I want to lay in bed and cry all day and I could really do with having sex right now. It was the weirdest thing and really not great emotional place be on birth control teenager."
1,"I’ve been on this over 3 years now. My first experience with birth control. It has done the job. 4-5 day light periods. I do feel more emotional on it but nothing crazy. I am switching pills only because I think it could be contributing to my fatigue. I have a low sex drive depending on where I’m at in the pill packet. Not good for trying to skip your period all together. I tried once and ended up bleeding for 10+ days. Overall it’s a decent pill and is effective at preventing pregnancy, but there may be better options out there."
1,"This pill has been my favorite birth control. It has completely cleared my hormonal acne. I have been on this pill for 2 years and counting. Although, I do get extremely tired some days it is still worth it in my opinion. Also, I do not get depression or anxiety like other pills. Give it a year, if able!"
1,"I have been on this pill for about 4 years and I would say it made me gain weight (10 pounds nothing serious) and had a lot of fluctuations in my skin but it overall helped my acne clear up. I have also been having unprotected sex for the last 4 years and this pill has me starting my period on the exact same day of each month. I feel confident that it protects me and I usually take it once a day at the same time, with the occasional missed pill absolutely rarely.  I think it turned me into an angrier person but overall I would recommend it"
0,Experience nausea and tons of headaches while on this birth control. Was told to take birth control later in day so I could essentially sleep through nausea. Decided to just switch birth control.
0,"Larissa had too many side effects for me. While it did help ease my period and make it lighter and more regular, I developed back acne, had weird dreams EVERY night, and completely lost my appetite. The side effects of this pill were worse than the the symptoms for why I went on it."
1,I’ve been on Larissia for about a year. I started it because my periods were very irregular. When I started I only weighed about 140 and over the span of the time I've been on this pill I've gained 25-30 pounds. I do have to say my periods are a lot lighter but still not super regular. They come and go as they please. I am looking into switching to another pill that will help get my on a regular schedule. Also I did get very bad anxiety and mood swings since I've started taking this pill. And I am also very bloated after eating anything which I never used to experience. I am looking into switching and getting off this pill. I have heard many good and bad things about it but I would not personally recommend.
0,"I got on birth control because me and my boyfriend have sex a lot, he doesn’t want to use condoms or pull out and I had a baby 8 months ago. At first everything was fine for the first month. Then I started to notice little things. Like how I’d get my period twice a month! I always get my period on the 1st or 2nd day of the month and usually lasts 3-4 days. Well last month my normal period came in and lasted 7 days!! Then the last week of February I started my period again which ended March 4th.Then 8 days later I started my period again!!! I also have no sex drive as well , I’m having mood swings which is not good.  I’ve never had trouble taking birth control especially since I’ve been on it since I was 16. I really wouldn’t recommend this medication."
0,"I was a healthy, active 30 year old training for a half marathon with no history of clotting disorders and no comorbidities on my third week of taking Larissia. I developed some chest pain/shortness of breath which I thought was a pulled muscle and anxiety.  This happened for 2 nights in a row.  The pain was much worse at night, and when lying down.  The next day, I called my PCP's office and they advised me to go to the ER.  Hours later I was diagnosed with a bilateral pulmonary embolism (blood clots in both lungs) and a pulmonary infarct that led to part of my lung dying. I was started on blood thinners and admitted into the hospital.  After having genetic testing completed, my hematologist informed me that this was all due to the birth control.  I never in my entire life would have imagined this was possible.  I hope that my story will educate other women on some of the possible life threatening side effects of birth control that everyone says are very ""rare"""
0,"I’ve been on Larissia for about 4 years now no acne weight gain or horrible periods. However the depression and mood swings are out of control. I can’t be happy for one day anymore. One little thing and I’m angry to balling my eyes out, sometimes it’s so bad. I have horrible thoughts for first year or so I thought it was just me but after seeing all of these reviews I'm starting to think it’s the birth control and that I should try and find a new one that won’t cause me to have this bad of depression. I don’t feel like myself at all anymore it’s tearing my relationship apart because I just get so worked up and crying and thoughts going. My boyfriend tries to calm me down but no matter what he says or does nothing cheers me up and I just want to be happy again and be back to who I used to be"
0,"I came on this website to see if anyone else was experiencing the same things. They are. I have been on Larissa for two years now. This was the 1st birth control I ever took. When I first started taking it I remember it gave me severe cramps!!! But all was good after I took it for a few months because I no longer had periods. Then I started developing side affects of  severe headaches, horrendous acne on my face and back, nausea all the time, light sensitivity to the point of many passing out spells, poor circulation in my hands and feet to the point of no feeling, vision loss, loss of appetite, severe sensitivity in boobs, weight loss & gain, horrendous mood swings, horrible anxiety, always feeling confused and many more. Don’t take this birth control! It’s not worth it. I’m in the stage right now of not taking it trying to get back to normal."
1,On the first week taking it I had migraines but it went away. The second and third week my breasts got really sore and it hurts. My sleep schedule changes it makes me go to bed in the afternoon then I end up waking up early in the morning
1,I was really nervous to start birth control but my experience with this pill has been great. I honestly haven’t noticed any side effects at all at any point while I’ve been taking it.
0,"It is awful. Ever since I've started taking Larissia I have been anxious and have had insomnia. While it does reduce my heavy periods, it seems to me like I'm just constantly on my period every single day. It makes me nauseous and there have been a few times I've thrown up because of it."
1,I am four days in and I have experience a slight fever and intense headache. We will see if it gets better the more I use it but that’s just what I’m experiencing on my first week
1,"Been on this birth control pill for two months now and I’m excited to say I finally found a good one for me. No nausea, no headaches, and feeling great. With any other birth control pill that I have tried throughout the years, I immediately get extremely nauseous and have to discontinue use. I was starting peri menopausal symptoms and this completely got rid of them…no more night sweats at all or annoying hot flashes. I will take this pill beyond the three months, nonstop, so that I never have a period again! Excellent!"
0,I took this birth control for about 2 years. It was great at first and I loved the less frequent period but my family and I began to notice it was making my anxiety and depression much worse and almost drove me to suicide. Couldn’t figure out why my mental health had worsened all of a sudden until I had to stop my birth control for a medical procedure. Wouldn’t recommend for someone with mental health issues.
0,The first two or three months I was fine using Ashlyna birth control. But Towards the end of my 3 month pack before I got to my placebo pills I got a brown menstrual cycle which I've never experienced before in my life. It went away for a week then when I started my next pack the brown menstrual cycle started literally a couple hours after I took the pill. After that I have had a brown menstrual cycle 24/7 everyday with some clotting for going on 6 weeks now. Yes you read it correctly I've had a brown menstrual cycle flowing every single day 24/7 for 6 weeks something is wrong with that and has put a damper on my sex life and I've been breaking out with little bumps on my forehead and the sides of my cheeks. My doctor told me to just go straight to the placebo pills then a new brand of birth control that has less estrogen in it. Instead I stopped taking Ashlyna altogether as I don't want any more harm being done to my body. I do NOT recommend this pill.
0,"Ashlyna was prescribed to me by my GYN for the treatment of PCOS. I took it about a week and felt okay before I started feeling faint, shaky, fatigue, rapid heart rate, intense anxiety, and panic attacks. It has been a month now of me trying to control the anxiety this birth control has caused me. I haven't been able to go to work or drive. I really do not recommend this medicine."
0.0,"Please do not take this specific birth control pill if you already deal with anxiety or depression. I have been taking Junel for 10 months and the last month of taking it I experience crippling anxiety. I had panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. I had the random thought to check out the side effects of Junel since it was the only prescription medicine I was taking and was shocked by the reviews. It seems pretty 50/50 but most of the people who had bad experiences talked about anxiety being a huge issue. I also realized the things I had been dealing with for months are also listed under side effects (hair loss, water retention, difficultly wearing contacts, insomnia, leg cramps, reduced tolerance to carbs) and quickly decided to discontinue use. It has only been just over a week but I can already feel such a difference. I still experience anxiety daily but such a little amount compared to before. I did read it can take a few months for side effects to go away."
1.0,"This is my most recent prescription and I can't say its been the best. I have had terrible mood swings, episodes of extreme anxiety, and no sex drive- which isn't the biggest deal for me. I am easily upset and have been crying very often. My poor boyfriend has been taking the front load of it all- he prob thinks I'm crazy at this point. I am not hungry as often and this has caused me to be light headed when I stand up. I only switched this brand and upped my dosage because my periods were not normal - I had one every two weeks. Thankfully, I have not gained weight because that was my biggest concern from the reviews I have read. I'm not over all thrilled while being on this prescription. I have PCOS and my mood swings and anxiety are more severe being on this. This medicine is almost putting my relationship on the line at this point."
0.0,"I took Junel FE 1.5/30 for five years, from the time that I was 18 to the time that I was 23.  I took it at the same time every day, and never had a single pregnancy scare.  

Please girls, remember: Birth control is HUGELY personal.  Our hormones are so sensitive.  What works for one, may not work for another.  

I would say that the first three years of the pill were fine for me and I had no issues except for one.  That issue? I would fall asleep every early afternoon and sleep for two or three hours.  I NEEDED a nap.  It was a family joke, a friend group joke.  I never connected it to my birth control.  That issue was the same issue for the full five years.  The last two years on it, however, I also lost my libido and felt totally disinterested in sex and less joyful that I'd ever felt.  That was really the last straw for me and I went off it in November of 2020.  Within a month, my sex drive was back, I wasn't sleeping all afternoon, and I felt better than I'd ever felt."
0.0,"I took Junel Fe 1.5/30 for about 9 months. I originally was on Junel Fe 1/20 but experienced some breakthrough bleeding months in so I switched to a higher dose. Everyone is different and everyone’s body is different however this pill did not work for me. I have a history of anxiety and depression and this pill made me insane. I cried so easy, I was so easily aggravated, I felt like I could never be happy and nothing could make me happy, like the smallest things bothered me.  Probably the worst mood swings I have ever experienced, and my doctor convinced me that it was normal. But after 9 months, I had had enough. I switched to another brand and feel so much better and so much more like myself. Never experienced any nausea or other symptoms. My skin was pretty decent on this pill too, however I care most about how I feel mentally. Also, I had been on birth control before this so I’m not sure if that effects it either."
1,"Initially I took Generess Fe for irregular periods. I was fortunate to have no side effects, weight gain, etc. I think it's worth a shot!"
1,I like this birth control I don’t have the mental side effects like anxiety I get with others. I’ve been taking it for a long time though and they recently changed their packaging to this thick white plastic thing that’s impossible to open and overall terrible. Please bring back the old normal thin packaging! What were  you thinking?
1,"I have PCOS and at times would bleed for months on end. I took Micronor to regulate my cycle and stayed on it for approx 5-6 months. I would say I experienced minimal side effects, some weight gain which I don't blame on the pill completely. It did regulate my cycles but I had a period frequently. My cycles were about 18-20 days, so it became frustrating but still better than bleeding 24/7."
0,"I took micronor for about 6 years and stopped. About two years later, I found out I had breast cancer. Not related to Genes. Read the warnings."
0,I have been on the Lessina pill for 3 years. 100% effective let me tell ya. Also gained like 10 pounds immediately after starting it. It leveled out a few months later but I do not recommend. Today I make the decision to get off of it because the side effects not worth it. I’m always hungry and bloated.
0,"This pill is the worst. I have been on many different etc pills due to insurance change and BCP discontinued YEARS. I have severe anxiety which I never have. I have heart palpitations and arrhythmias my new cardiologist says are benign. I have insomnia, nausea, bloating, spotting every week, and sweating! I have endometriosis which is awful but this pill takes the cake."
1,"I was super nervous about getting on birth control because of the horror stories and my previous experience from other pills. 
I spent a few months researching pills and asking friends what pill worked for them, because I was going to start nursing school and did not want a surprise during that that time. After nine years of not being on the pill and a lot of research, I took a chance with Lessina.
I’ve been on it for five months and I love it! The first two months I was very emotional, but I’m sure it was from the pill trying to regulate. Month 3 period was the heaviest, but once again I think it was from the pill regulating. 
I have gained weight, but since I’ve started nursing school, I haven’t been active and I eat crap every day, so I can’t blame the pill. I’m emotional at random times throughout the month, but that’s it. I don’t have severe moods swings, I’m not angry, I don’t get headaches, I’m not depressed…. I really think this pill is a great option."
0,"I took this starting my Junior year in high school back in 2014 was on it for about 6 years then got off it, recently started it again back in December 2021 it's been 3 months taking it, my acne is cleared sometimes. I cant seem to shake the soreness in my breast and I seem to spot a lot. I am not sure if it's because as I get older my body changes. But since I started again I've been a little moody, tired and when I wake up I feel super bloated and heavy and just discomfort in my stomach. My OBGYN said to stay on the pack and after 3 packs my body should get used to it, but I feel as if it's not changing. When I started it back in 2014 I never had any problems, but now I seem to have the side effects and I am not sure if I should stay on it in hopes they stop or try something else. I have not gained weight but in my boobs I did."
0,"I’m 23 years old and recently got diagnosed with PCOS. In October of 2021, my gyn placed me on Kariva to help with the symptoms of PCOS (acne, missed period for months, body hairs). Instantly, my skin began to break out 10x worse, but I remembered my gyn mentioning a purging period so I continued to use the bc. Over the course of the 4 months I was on this pull, not only did my skin look terrible, but my mental health was in the gutters. I was crying everyday, I was super paranoid about literally every little thing, I had suicidal thoughts and so much more than I never thought could happen to me. Often you hear people talking about what bc does to them but you never think you’d ever be in that position and that’s what I thought. After giving it a chance, I returned to my gyn and she took me off of them and within days, my sanity returned. I’ve been off the pill for 1 month and I can’t explain how grateful I am."
1,"it works for me (so far) and I have been taking it for 3 years now, but has caused many mood changes"
0,"I was recently switched to Larin Fe without my knowledge because Junel Fe was out of stock so they switched to a generic brand and the name was covered on the label so I didn’t think anything of it. That last two months I have been broken out head to toe with severe breakouts, couldn’t sleep at all and random severe anxiety and I would snap in a second over the stupidest things. I now stopped taking it all together and can now sleep my breakouts are clearing up and no more anxiety or feeling to cry or snap at anyone. I would never recommend this birth control to anyone. And feel pharmacist should be letting us know when there is a change from regular to generic brands for this reason. I pray this saves someone from making the wrong choice."
0,"I was on a specific pill for three years, but my body began to no longer cooperate with that pill so I had to make a switch. I switched to Junel Fe 24 and about 4-5 months in couldn’t take it anymore with how bad the side effects were. It was in the midst of Covid so instead of going in for a visit, my doctor talked to me over the phone to prescribe Larin fe 1/20. Little did I know was that this is the generic version of Junel Fe!! The only thing she told me to do is give it longer to adjust with my body. I have given plenty of time and can’t take it anymore. I have the most horrendous list of side effects I could have imagined. My body doesn’t feel like my own anymore. Do not recommend."
1,"As a first time birth control user, I was really nervous about the side effects we have all heard from birth control horror stories. Thankfully, on this birth control, I experienced little to no side effects. I experienced little to no change in body weight and my acne has cleared up almost completely. (My breasts do swell sometimes and it can be painful for a week or two, but this is rare.) The first two months were not great. I struggled with breakthrough bleeding and was frustrated and startled by the intensity and quantities of the bleeds which lasted for 7-10 days at a time. But after completing about 2.5 packs, my breakthrough bleeding stopped completely and now when I take my placebo week, my withdrawal bleeding lasts about 4-5 days and it’s extremely light. No awful mood changes. Haven’t gotten pregnant either!! lol"
1,"Originally on Junel Fe 1/20 but needed substitution as no pharmacys locally are carrying that anymore, so Larin Fe 1/20 was substituted. Started getting acne on my shoulders AND breasts???  Plus the packaging is ugly  compared to others I've seen. Switching brands"
0,I had a very negative experience with this birth control. I only took it for one month and had to switch brands. It made me have the worst anxiety and depression of my life to the point where I couldn’t leave my bed. It also gave me terrible breakout's. Everyone’s body reacts differently but I wouldn’t recommend this birth control to anyone.
1,"I suggest this BC anytime someone asks or complains about their BC or their period. However, I will note it is best when you take the actual Camrese and not a “comparable” med. I switched pharmacies because one always gave me Ashlynna as a substitute and I definitely noticed way more break through bleeding, plus the package is cardboard and if it’s gets wet (I travel a lot and carry water bottles) the case will fall apart, vs actual Camrese the package is plastic and much more durable. I have taken this almost 3 years now and it’s GREAT. No pregnancies and a period only 3 months. The only thing I will say is I start spotting that third month and randomly sometimes before the placebo week but it is just as stated.. spotting. NOT a full blown period. Cramps are barely existent and my flow is not as heavy. Plus an actual period only comes during placebos. Best pill I’ve ever tried and I’ve been on birth control almost a decade."
0.0,"This was the second brand of birth control I've tried after the first one made me feel horrible emotionally. However, this one isn't that much better. It started out fine during the first pack, but then it started making me so nauseous that I woke up to throw up in the middle of the night. This also happened a different night on the second pack. It hasn't happened since, but now I occasionally feel like throwing up or have other pain in my stomach area. The other issue is how much it makes me sweat. Before trying the pill I would have the occasional anxiety sweats, but nothing unmanageable. Now, sweat literally DRIPS down my arms, especially during the placebo week. I can't get my body to a comfortable temperature on my period and it makes an already hard week that much difficult. I don't think this pill works for my body at all, so I will definitely switch. It is very effective though, I will say."
1.0,I’ve been on it for about 9 months now and I like it. I skip the placebo but still seem to get a period but it’s a lot lighter and almost pain free. I’ve noticed that I’ve been able to lose/maintain my weight since being on it and it’s worked fine on my acne as well. Don’t let all the negative reviews worry you. Everyone’s different
0.0,"p>		“I had to come off of Tri-Previfem (which I have been on it for almost 10 yrs for PCOS and it worked SO well for me until recently), and my gyno switched me to this birth control. The first week I didn't notice a difference, but when my body really started to react with the hormones I got bloating that hasn't gone away and I began breaking out. On Tri-Previfem I had glowing skin all the time and now I feel like I'm in high school again. I cannot stand the constant bloating. I feel like I've gained ten pounds and my boobs are at least a size if not two bigger. I'm at the end of month two and I can't do it anymore. Not the pill for me.”</p"
0.0,"This is easily the worst birth control I’ve ever been on, I’ve gained 30 pounds, non stop issues regarding my female health, has given me acne. It is so awful, do not recommend this birth control what so ever. My doctor switched me to this one as I was having issues while on the previous one and it exacerbated the problem. I’ve been on it for over a year and nothing has gotten better. I’ve been tested for everything underneath the sun and the only thing it comes back to is how this birth control has my hormones all messed up."
1.0,"Honestly, in the first two months I did have side effects like nausea, weight gain, and got bad acne, but I knew that my body would get use to it. After that my body went back to normal and my skin cleared up, I wasn’t nauseous anymore and I started loosing weight easily. As for mental health, it never made me get depression or anxiety, but then again, I never had that in the past so maybe that’s why I never developed it. My periods came every month and never got cramps or heavy blood, before I was on the pill my cramps were bad and painful so I’m glad they’re not anymore. Again, all bodies are different but I really like this birth control for me."
0.0,"This birth control is the WORST! I started taking it February 3 which was the first day of my period. And I haven't stopped bleeding since. I have a tubal and was only prescribed this medication due to a very thickened endometrium. I consulted with my doctor whom told me to stop taking it for 4 days. I stopped, and I am still bleeding. It's been 3 weeks since I have been bleeding while taking this medication. The bleeding was light at first now that I am not on the pill the bleeding is like a heavy period. I DON'T RECOMMENDED THIS MEDICATION TO ANYONE! I am definitely taking myself off of this and going to something else."
1.0,"I got switched to this brand from Sprintec/Tri-Sprintec and after reading reviews, I was so scared to even start taking it. But Mono-Linyah has been soooo much better than Sprintec, Tri-Sprintec and Estarylla. I used to get nauseous immediately after taking those, had mild headaches, no appetite and NO sex drive at all. Now, after only one month on Mono-Linyah, I feel a whole lot better. I have zero side effects after taking it, no nausea/headaches and my sex drive is finally back. My period is the same as it was when I was on Sprintec, about 3-4 days long. The only downfall I’ve noticed is that my face has a few more small pimples the week of my period but nothing too bad, as they’re very tiny (and could be caused by anything not just the BC). Overall, I’m happy and will continue taking this."
0.0,"Okay so, this birth control is definitely not as good as I was told. Even my doctors have said plenty of side-effects. I have experienced, stomach pains, sore breasts, dizziness, and a massive change in my hormones. I do not recommend if you are on other medications and make sure to ask a doctor how it'll effect you before asking to be put on it."
0.0,I was on this pill before which was last year and when I took it it was perfectly fine. It helped with my cramps that were pretty bad and I was very heavy and my face was so clear. I stopped talking it and then got back on it again and let me tell you I’ve never been like this before. My face broke out SO bad. I’ve been SO moody and crying all the time for no reason one moment I would be fine next I would be mad for no reason I thought there was something wrong with me but it’s really ruining me and if you feel like this also you are not alone and it’s not worth taking it anymore. Definitely talk to your doctor about getting on something else because your mental health is important. And i feel so bad for the people around me because I’m just so moody and it’s not fair to them
0.0,"I’m sure this BC works for some people, but it did not for me. I had the worst nausea of my life, I had to stop taking it. I also had bad headaches, and was so tired from not being able to eat or sleep. I will definitely be switching to a progesterone only BC, this has too much estrogen for me."
0,"Took this pill for almost 2 years. I developed severe anxiety on it and 0 sex drive. Another thing, it caused me to have a blood clot in my calf. Please don’t take this!!"
0,"I started this BCP because I was supposed to get on Accutane and the derm would not let me have it with out being on birth control (bc). I had never been on bc before and really didn’t want to but I was suffering with severe cystic acne, blackheads, whiteheads etc. I’ve always had acne since middle school but it was only about 2 cysts on my chin, but my face was bad after I had twins, it was all over my cheeks, jawline and forehead. I started this and I tell you within the first month my acne was clear! I was so excited because I didn’t have to get on accutane! But it all went downhill very quickly. I already have anxiety but it caused me to have anxiety like I have never experienced. Extreme emotional meltdowns, depression, panic attacks, stomach and digestive issues. It also made my periods irregular. I wouldn’t bleed for a month and then bleed for 2 weeks straight. Seriously would not recommend. I even read these reviews before trying it and should have known better."
1.0,"After I had my daughter I didn't have a period for 2 years and I never even had a regular period. After the 2 years I started having periods and it became so extremely regular I could feel myself ovulating and it was an odd feeling given I never had that before. That being said, I ended up with PMDD. I was ALWAYS tired and miserable for 3 weeks every month and the only time I felt normal was the day of my period. First week taking Junel was a miracle my PMDD was gone. Month 2 had a breakthrough bleed for 5 days. I've been bleeding for two weeks mid pack 3 so I am doing a reset and I hope that stops it. I took the pill continuously to stop my period. So it'll be 3 weeks of bleeding? I did need to gain weight and this helped. I now fit my clothes and bras again. I went up a whole cup size in 2 months. I hope the ""reset"" will stop the bleeding and it will make me feel normal again. I am worried I will bleed for weeks after ""reset"" and PMDD returns. It was working so well in the beginning."
1.0,"I got prescribed this birth control back in 2019 when my doctor diagnosed me with PCOS.. I took it for awhile but had a hard time remembering to take them on time so I switched to the Depo shot which I didn’t like at all. But I got back on the pill around Oct 2021 since I was in a relationship and I didn’t trust condoms 
I had a few months of bleeding that would last for about 6 days sometimes less with minimal cramps, some weight gain and nausea but it has subsided. But for the past 2 or 3 months I’ve only had light brownish spotting that’ll last 2 or 3 days.. I’m not sure if that’s normal but I took a pregnancy last month and it was negative. Other than that I don’t have a lot of acne breakouts except maybe on my chin every now and then and the normal PMS symptoms before a period"
0.0,I only took for 5 days because I got so incredibly nauseous and had diarrhea so much so that I couldn’t work for a day and just couldn’t keep taking them.
0.0,"I originally started out with Sprintec and could immediately see weight gain, swollen breasts and severe mood changes. So I switched to Junel, and my breasts were no longer swollen and I lost weight. My skin has been incredibly clear, very regular periods, light, and no cramps really… but this pill has affected me sexually. I am constantly having back to back UTIs, despite cleaning thoroughly after intercourse. And I no longer have a sex drive. The first year my bf and I were together, I was completely different, but since Junel, I have a hard time wanting to engage in ANY kind of sexual act. It has also put my emotions on blast. I am incredibly angry, I cannot control how I feel anymore. This pill seriously has damaged my mental & physical health. I know a lot of people have a great experience, so don’t let my review turn you away. But if you feel this way on this pill, know you aren’t alone. I thought I was crazy but I am about to get off this pill."
0.0,"I started this for birth control just for a few months until my husband's vasectomy was scheduled. After week 3 of taking these pills I had a huge panic attack that almost landed me in the ER followed by a whole day of puking. Nauseous 24/7. In the following days, the anxiety and panic attacks were too much to bear. I wouldn't wish the way I felt those days on anyone!! I was miserable. I then became super depressed, crying every single night for absolutely no reason. My heart would race constantly which would then cause more anxiety. I lost myself and who I was and I'm thankful I realized this is what the cause was. I literally thought I was losing my mind and just waiting to die. The things these hormones can do to your body is scary! I immediately stopped taking it. If you have had or currently have any mental health issues, I would stay far far away."
0.0,"Ok so I'm 19 and wanted to start bc as I’m sexually active now so I went to my gyno and she gave me this. Now I was hesitant at first but I’ve been taking it for a month and I have been feeling nauseous, I even felt so bad I had to force it out of my system. I’ve been having yeast infections as well. Also HOO WEE the weight gain. Now, I’m 5’6 and I have a fast metabolism so I was always 120 and always had a good body, but after taking this I have stomach fat and now weight 135lb. I could essentially work out cause I don’t but it’s crazy that a birth control is messing with my hormones that much that I have to go to that length. I also have depression and anxiety sometimes but I just feel more unmotivated than usual, which isn’t helping cause I’m in school. Anyways the only maybe good thing is that you may not get your period but this ain’t worth it. I didn’t even read these reviews until now bc I was seriously getting concerned with my weight gain"
1.0,"This is my third year on Junel Fe. It is the best birth control I've had. Historically, my periods were painful. I missed work and could not function for the first day or two of getting my period. After having a daughter, my doctor prescribed this pill. I experienced intense nausea the first two weeks, comparable to morning sickness. This went away. I have lost weight on Junel Fe. My moods were noticeably regulated during the pre and menstrual phase. My periods went from moderately heavy and passing clots, to light periods, to no periods, after a year of use. I did find that if I missed 3 pills, I would experience breakthrough bleeding that lasted a few weeks, leading to the need for a reset. Every woman is unique. This has worked for me, and I ask for it specifically when some doctors attempt to give me a generic or different brand."
1,"p>		“I know a lot of people come here to leave neg. reviews so I thought I’d review my experience. I have Inguinal endometriosis, PCOS, ovarian cyst.  Ladies, remember there are hundreds of thousands of women on BC &amp; for some reason people rarely review the positives. I came on here to read them before I got on the pill &amp; I was terrified by them, but figured what I was going through was worse than the side effects.  I’ve been on this BC for 4 weeks &amp; I’ve had ZERO side effects. No weight gain, no headaches, absolutely nothing. I have an alarm set on my phone to take it at 9pm &amp; I’ve done that religiously. Everyone’s body reacts differently. What’s bad for one may possibly be great for another, just like any other medication on the market. You can always take them &amp; if you don’t like them, stop. It’s a trial &amp; error kind of thing. So far I’m happy with my choice to take these even though I hesitated due to the reviews.”</p"
0.0,"Awful!! Terrible!! I used NuvaRing for an IVF cycle and since it has gone generic, my insurance doesn’t cover it so I tried the EluRyng for the latest cycle.  I have been feeling very angry with crazy mood swings, depression and anxiety.  I had to take it out because my mental health is severely suffering. I’m also starting to get headaches. I tried to wait it out - after 2 months maybe things would level out, but it just got worse. Big pharma and insurance companies don’t care about women’s health, and unless you do your research and advocate for yourself, they’ll just roll right over you. Would rate 0 if I could. This medication is dangerous."
0.0,"I was on the Nuvaring for years. It was the only medication that worked to regulate my cycle and stop the heavy bleeding, spotting, and extreme cramps I experienced with my period. As soon as this generic version came out, my insurance stopped covering the Nuvaring and I was given this.  I tried it and felt terrible: nausea, a horrible headache behind my eyes, bloating, cramps, cystic acne, extreme fatigue, and spotting. Unlike others, I’ve lost weight but can’t afford that, as I’m at the bottom of my acceptable weight range.  I don’t understand how this medication can even be compared to the name brand when it works this poorly."
1.0,"I avoided this for too long due to reviews here but I don't want to pay $$$ for Nuvaring and Annovera gave me two week periods so I gave EluRyng a shot. It has been an amazing, easy experience. Super light, regular periods and no pms or nausea (which nuvaring gave me). I recommend giving it a try despite the scary reviews since everyone is different."
